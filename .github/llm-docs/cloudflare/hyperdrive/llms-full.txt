Turn your existing regional database into a globally distributed database.

Available on Free and Paid plans

Hyperdrive is a service that accelerates queries you make to existing databases, making it faster to access your data from across the globe from [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), irrespective of your users' location.

Hyperdrive supports any Postgres or MySQL database, including those hosted on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Neon and Planetscale. Hyperdrive also supports Postgres-compatible databases like CockroachDB and Timescale. You do not need to write new code or replace your favorite tools: Hyperdrive works with your existing code and tools you use.

Use Hyperdrive's connection string from your Cloudflare Workers application with your existing Postgres drivers and object-relational mapping (ORM) libraries:

* PostgreSQL

  * index.ts

    ```ts
    import postgres from 'postgres';


    export default {
      async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
        // Hyperdrive provides a unique generated connection string to connect to
        // your database via Hyperdrive that can be used with your existing tools
        const sql = postgres(env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString);


          try {
            // Sample SQL query
            const results = await sql`SELECT * FROM pg_tables`;


            // Close the client after the response is returned
            ctx.waitUntil(sql.end());


            return Response.json(results);
          } catch (e) {
            return Response.json({ error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : e }, { status: 500 });
          }
        },


    } satisfies ExportedHandler<{ HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive }>;
    ```

  * wrangler.jsonc

    ```json
      {
        "$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
        "name": "WORKER-NAME",
        "main": "src/index.ts",
        "compatibility_date": "2025-02-04",
        "compatibility_flags": [
          "nodejs_compat"
        ],
        "observability": {
          "enabled": true
        },
        "hyperdrive": [
          {

            "localConnectionString": "<ENTER_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_FOR_LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_HERE>"
          }
        ]
      }
    ```

* MySQL

  * index.ts

    ```ts
    import { createConnection  } from 'mysql2/promise';


    export default {
     async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
        const connection = await createConnection({
         host: env.DB_HOST,
         user: env.DB_USER,
         password: env.DB_PASSWORD,
         database: env.DB_NAME,
         port: env.DB_PORT


           // This is needed to use mysql2 with Workers
         // This configures mysql2 to use static parsing instead of eval() parsing (not available on Workers)
         disableEval: true


    });


    const [results, fields] = await connection.query(
    'SHOW tables;'
    );


    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ results, fields }), {
    headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '\*',
    },
    });
    },
    } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

description: Hyperdrive accelerates access to your existing databases from
  Cloudflare Workers, making even single-region databases feel globally
  distributed.

Hyperdrive accelerates access to your existing databases from Cloudflare Workers, making even single-region databases feel globally distributed.

By maintaining a connection pool to your database within Cloudflare's network, Hyperdrive reduces seven round-trips to your database before you can even send a query: the TCP handshake (1x), TLS negotiation (3x), and database authentication (3x).

Hyperdrive understands the difference between read and write queries to your database, and caches the most common read queries, improving performance and reducing load on your origin database.

This guide will instruct you through:

* Creating your first Hyperdrive configuration.
* Creating a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and binding it to your Hyperdrive configuration.
* Establishing a database connection from your Worker to a public database.

Note

Hyperdrive currently works with PostgreSQL, MySQL and many compatible databases. This includes CockroachDB and Materialize (which are PostgreSQL-compatible), and Planetscale.

Learn more about the [databases that Hyperdrive supports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/reference/supported-databases-and-features).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following:

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Use a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.
3. Have **a publicly accessible** PostgreSQL/MySQL (or compatible) database.

## 1. Log in

Before creating your Hyperdrive binding, log in with your Cloudflare account by running:

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

You will be directed to a web page asking you to log in to the Cloudflare dashboard. After you have logged in, you will be asked if Wrangler can make changes to your Cloudflare account. Scroll down and select **Allow** to continue.

## 2. Create a Worker

New to Workers?

Refer to [How Workers works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/how-workers-works/) to learn about the Workers serverless execution model works. Go to the [Workers Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/) to set up your first Worker.

Create a new project named `hyperdrive-tutorial` by running:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- hyperdrive-tutorial
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare hyperdrive-tutorial
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest hyperdrive-tutorial
  ```

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `TypeScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

This will create a new `hyperdrive-tutorial` directory. Your new `hyperdrive-tutorial` directory will include:

* A `"Hello World"` [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/#3-write-code) at `src/index.ts`.
* A [`wrangler.jsonc`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file. `wrangler.jsonc` is how your `hyperdrive-tutorial` Worker will connect to Hyperdrive.

### Enable Node.js compatibility

[Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) is required for database drivers, and needs to be configured for your Workers project.

To enable both built-in runtime APIs and polyfills for your Worker or Pages project, add the [`nodejs_compat`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) [compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/), and set your compatibility date to September 23rd, 2024 or later. This will enable [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) for your Workers project.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23"
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
  ```

## 3. Connect Hyperdrive to a database

Hyperdrive works by connecting to your database, pooling database connections globally, and speeding up your database access through Cloudflare's network.

It will provide a secure connection string that is only accessible from your Worker which you can use to connect to your database through Hyperdrive. This means that you can use the Hyperdrive connection string with your existing drivers or ORM libraries without needing significant changes to your code.

To create your first Hyperdrive database configuration, change into the directory you just created for your Workers project:

```sh
cd hyperdrive-tutorial
```

To create your first Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`).
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres` or `mysql`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

* PostgreSQL

  ```txt
  postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
  ```

  Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

  To create a Hyperdrive connection, run the `wrangler` command, replacing the placeholder values passed to the `--connection-string` flag with the values of your existing database:

  ```sh
  npx wrangler hyperdrive create <YOUR_CONFIG_NAME> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
  ```

* MySQL

  ```txt
  mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
  ```

  Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

  To create a Hyperdrive connection, run the `wrangler` command, replacing the placeholder values passed to the `--connection-string` flag with the values of your existing database:

  ```sh
  npx wrangler hyperdrive create <YOUR_CONFIG_NAME> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
  ```

Manage caching

By default, Hyperdrive will cache query results. If you wish to disable caching, pass the flag `--caching-disabled`.

Alternatively, you can use the `--max-age` flag to specify the maximum duration (in seconds) for which items should persist in the cache, before they are evicted. Default value is 60 seconds.

Refer to [Hyperdrive Wrangler commands](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/reference/wrangler-commands/) for more information.

If successful, the command will output your new Hyperdrive configuration:

```json
{
  "hyperdrive": [
    {
      "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
      "id": "<example id: 57b7076f58be42419276f058a8968187>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Copy the `id` field: you will use this in the next step to make Hyperdrive accessible from your Worker script.

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

## 4. Bind your Worker to Hyperdrive

You must create a binding in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for your Worker to connect to your Hyperdrive configuration. [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to access resources, like Hyperdrive, on the Cloudflare developer platform.

To bind your Hyperdrive configuration to your Worker, add the following to the end of your Wrangler file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>" # the ID associated with the Hyperdrive you just created
  ```

Specifically:

* The value (string) you set for the `binding` (binding name) will be used to reference this database in your Worker. In this tutorial, name your binding `HYPERDRIVE`.
* The binding must be [a valid JavaScript variable name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables). For example, `binding = "hyperdrive"` or `binding = "productionDB"` would both be valid names for the binding.
* Your binding is available in your Worker at `env.<BINDING_NAME>`.

If you wish to use a local database during development, you can add a `localConnectionString` to your Hyperdrive configuration with the connection string of your database:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>",
        "localConnectionString": "<LOCAL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>" # the ID associated with the Hyperdrive you just created
  localConnectionString = "<LOCAL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI>"
  ```

Note

Learn more about setting up [Hyperdrive for local development](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/local-development/).

## 5. Run a query against your database

Once you have created a Hyperdrive configuration and bound it to your Worker, you can run a query against your database.

### Install a database driver

* PostgreSQL

  To connect to your database, you will need a database driver which allows you to authenticate and query your database. For this tutorial, you will use [node-postgres (pg)](https://node-postgres.com/), one of the most widely used PostgreSQL drivers.

  To install `pg`, ensure you are in the `hyperdrive-tutorial` directory. Open your terminal and run the following command:

  * npm

    ```sh
    # This should install v8.13.0 or later
    npm i pg
    ```

  * yarn

    ```sh
    # This should install v8.13.0 or later
    yarn add pg
    ```

  * pnpm

    ```sh
    # This should install v8.13.0 or later
    pnpm add pg
    ```

  If you are using TypeScript, you should also install the type definitions for `pg`:

  * npm

    ```sh
    # This should install v8.13.0 or later
    npm i -D @types/pg
    ```

  * yarn

    ```sh
    # This should install v8.13.0 or later
    yarn add -D @types/pg
    ```

  * pnpm

    ```sh
    # This should install v8.13.0 or later
    pnpm add -D @types/pg
    ```

  With the driver installed, you can now create a Worker script that queries your database.

* MySQL

  To connect to your database, you will need a database driver which allows you to authenticate and query your database. For this tutorial, you will use [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2), one of the most widely used MySQL drivers.

  To install `mysql2`, ensure you are in the `hyperdrive-tutorial` directory. Open your terminal and run the following command:

  * npm

    ```sh
    # This should install v3.13.0 or later
    npm i mysql2
    ```

  * yarn

    ```sh
    # This should install v3.13.0 or later
    yarn add mysql2
    ```

  * pnpm

    ```sh
    # This should install v3.13.0 or later
    pnpm add mysql2
    ```

  With the driver installed, you can now create a Worker script that queries your database.

* npm

  ```sh
  # This should install v8.13.0 or later
  npm i pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  # This should install v8.13.0 or later
  yarn add pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  # This should install v8.13.0 or later
  pnpm add pg
  ```

* npm

  ```sh
  # This should install v8.13.0 or later
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  # This should install v8.13.0 or later
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  # This should install v8.13.0 or later
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

* npm

  ```sh
  # This should install v3.13.0 or later
  npm i mysql2
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  # This should install v3.13.0 or later
  yarn add mysql2
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  # This should install v3.13.0 or later
  pnpm add mysql2
  ```

### Write a Worker

* PostgreSQL

  After you have set up your database, you will run a SQL query from within your Worker.

  Go to your `hyperdrive-tutorial` Worker and open the `index.ts` file.

  The `index.ts` file is where you configure your Worker's interactions with Hyperdrive.

  Populate your `index.ts` file with the following code:

  ```typescript
  // pg 8.13.0 or later is recommended
  import { Client } from "pg";


  export interface Env {
    // If you set another name in the Wrangler config file as the value for 'binding',
    // replace "HYPERDRIVE" with the variable name you defined.
    HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
  }


  export default {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
      // Create a client using the pg driver (or any supported driver, ORM or query builder)
      // with the Hyperdrive credentials. These credentials are only accessible from your Worker.
      const sql = new Client({
        connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
      });


      try {
        // Connect to the database
        await sql.connect();


        // Sample query
        const results = await sql.query(`SELECT * FROM pg_tables`);


        // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
        ctx.waitUntil(sql.end());


        // Return result rows as JSON
        return Response.json(results.rows);
      } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return Response.json(
          { error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : e },
          { status: 500 },
        );
      }
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
  ```

  Upon receiving a request, the code above does the following:

  1. Creates a new database client configured to connect to your database via Hyperdrive, using the Hyperdrive connection string.
  2. Initiates a query via `await sql.query()` that outputs all tables (user and system created) in the database (as an example query).
  3. Returns the response as JSON to the client.

* MySQL

  After you have set up your database, you will run a SQL query from within your Worker.

  Go to your `hyperdrive-tutorial` Worker and open the `index.ts` file.

  The `index.ts` file is where you configure your Worker's interactions with Hyperdrive.

  Populate your `index.ts` file with the following code:

  ```typescript
  // mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
  import { createConnection  } from 'mysql2/promise';


  export interface Env {
    // If you set another name in the Wrangler config file as the value for 'binding',
    // replace "HYPERDRIVE" with the variable name you defined.
    HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
  }


  export default {
   async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {


      // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver (or any support driver, ORM or query builder)
      // with the Hyperdrive credentials. These credentials are only accessible from your Worker.
      const connection = await createConnection({
        host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
        user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
        password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
        database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
        port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port


        // The following line is needed for mysql2 compatibility with Workers
        // mysql2 uses eval() to optimize result parsing for rows with > 100 columns
        // Configure mysql2 to use static parsing instead of eval() parsing with disableEval
        disableEval: true
      });


      try{
        // Sample query
        const [results, fields] = await connection.query(
          'SHOW tables;'
        );


        // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
        ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


        // Return result rows as JSON
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ results, fields }), {
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
          },
        });
      }
      catch(e){
        console.error(e);
        return Response.json(
          { error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : e },
          { status: 500 },
        );
      }


   },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
  ```

  Upon receiving a request, the code above does the following:

  1. Creates a new database client configured to connect to your database via Hyperdrive, using the Hyperdrive connection string.
  2. Initiates a query via `await connection.query` that outputs all tables (user and system created) in the database (as an example query).
  3. Returns the response as JSON to the client.

## 6. Deploy your Worker

You can now deploy your Worker to make your project accessible on the Internet. To deploy your Worker, run:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
# Outputs: https://hyperdrive-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
```

You can now visit the URL for your newly created project to query your live database.

For example, if the URL of your new Worker is `hyperdrive-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`, accessing `https://hyperdrive-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/` will send a request to your Worker that queries your database directly.

By finishing this tutorial, you have created a Hyperdrive configuration, a Worker to access that database and deployed your project globally.

Hyperdrive can securely connect to your private databases using [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) and [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/).

## How it works

When your database is isolated within a private network (such as a [virtual private cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-a-virtual-private-cloud) or an on-premise network), you must enable a secure connection from your network to Cloudflare.

* [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) is used to establish the secure tunnel connection.
* [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) is used to restrict access to your tunnel such that only specific Hyperdrive configurations can access it.

A request from the Cloudflare Worker to the origin database goes through Hyperdrive, Cloudflare Access, and the Cloudflare Tunnel established by `cloudflared`. `cloudflared` must be running in the private network in which your database is accessible.

The Cloudflare Tunnel will establish an outbound bidirectional connection from your private network to Cloudflare. Cloudflare Access will secure your Cloudflare Tunnel to be only accessible by your Hyperdrive configuration.

![A request from the Cloudflare Worker to the origin database goes through Hyperdrive, Cloudflare Access and the Cloudflare Tunnel established by cloudflared.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/hyperdrive-private-database-architecture.BrGTjEln_2iaw6y.webp)

## Before you start

All of the tutorials assume you have already completed the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/), which gets you set up with a Cloudflare Workers account, [C3](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare), and [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

Warning

If your organization also uses [Super Bot Fight Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/super-bot-fight-mode/), keep **Definitely Automated** set to **Allow**. Otherwise, tunnels might fail with a `websocket: bad handshake` error.

## Prerequisites

* A database in your private network, [configured to use TLS/SSL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/#supported-tls-ssl-modes).
* A hostname on your Cloudflare account, which will be used to route requests to your database.

## 1. Create a tunnel in your private network

### 1.1. Create a tunnel

First, create a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) in your private network to establish a secure connection between your network and Cloudflare. Your network must be configured such that the tunnel has permissions to egress to the Cloudflare network and access the database within your network.

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) and go to **Networks** > **Tunnels**.

2. Select **Create a tunnel**.

3. Choose **Cloudflared** for the connector type and select **Next**.

4. Enter a name for your tunnel. We suggest choosing a name that reflects the type of resources you want to connect through this tunnel (for example, `enterprise-VPC-01`).

5. Select **Save tunnel**.

6. Next, you will need to install `cloudflared` and run it. To do so, check that the environment under **Choose an environment** reflects the operating system on your machine, then copy the command in the box below and paste it into a terminal window. Run the command.

7. Once the command has finished running, your connector will appear in Zero Trust.

   ![Connector appearing in the UI after cloudflared has run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/connector.DgDJjokf_1bYl1O.webp)

8. Select **Next**.

### 1.2. Connect your database using a public hostname

Your tunnel must be configured to use a public hostname so that Hyperdrive can route requests to it. If you don't have a hostname on Cloudflare yet, you will need to [register a new hostname](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/register-domain/) or [add a zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/) to Cloudflare to proceed.

1. In the **Public Hostnames** tab, choose a **Domain** and specify any subdomain or path information. This will be used in your Hyperdrive configuration to route to this tunnel.

2. In the **Service** section, specify **Type** `TCP` and the URL and configured port of your database, such as `localhost:5432` or `my-database-host.database-provider.com:5432`. This address will be used by the tunnel to route requests to your database.

3. Select **Save tunnel**.

Note

If you are setting up the tunnel through the CLI instead ([locally-managed tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/)), you will have to complete these steps manually. Follow the Cloudflare Zero Trust documentation to [add a public hostname to your tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/routing-to-tunnel/dns/) and [configure the public hostname to route to the address of your database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/configuration-file/).

## 2. Create and configure Hyperdrive to connect to the Cloudflare Tunnel

To restrict access to the Cloudflare Tunnel to Hyperdrive, a [Cloudflare Access application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/) must be configured with a [Policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/) that requires requests to contain a valid [Service Auth token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/#service-auth).

The Cloudflare dashboard can automatically create and configure the underlying [Cloudflare Access application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/), [Service Auth token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/#service-auth), and [Policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/) on your behalf. Alternatively, you can manually create the Access application and configure the Policies.

* Automatic creation

  ### 2.1 Create a Hyperdrive configuration in the Cloudflare dashboard

  Create a Hyperdrive configuration in the Cloudflare dashboard to automatically configure Hyperdrive to connect to your Cloudflare Tunnel.

  1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive), navigate to **Storage & Databases > Hyperdrive** and click **Create configuration**.
  2. Select **Private database**.
  3. In the **Networking details** section, select the tunnel you are connecting to.
  4. In the **Networking details** section, select the hostname associated to the tunnel. If there is no hostname for your database, return to step [1.2. Connect your database using a public hostname](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/#12-connect-your-database-using-a-public-hostname).
  5. In the **Access Service Authentication Token** section, select **Create new (automatic)**.
  6. In the **Access Application** section, select **Create new (automatic)**.
  7. In the **Database connection details** section, enter the database **name**, **user**, and **password**.

* Manual creation

  ### 2.1 Create a service token

  The service token will be used to restrict requests to the tunnel, and is needed for the next step.

  1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Service auth** > **Service Tokens**.

  2. Select **Create Service Token**.

  3. Name the service token. The name allows you to easily identify events related to the token in the logs and to revoke the token individually.

  4. Set a **Service Token Duration** of `Non-expiring`. This prevents the service token from expiring, ensuring it can be used throughout the life of the Hyperdrive configuration.

  5. Select **Generate token**. You will see the generated Client ID and Client Secret for the service token, as well as their respective request headers.

  6. Copy the Access Client ID and Access Client Secret. These will be used when creating the Hyperdrive configuration.

     Warning

     This is the only time Cloudflare Access will display the Client Secret. If you lose the Client Secret, you must regenerate the service token.

  ### 2.2 Create an Access application to secure the tunnel

  [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) will be used to verify that requests to the tunnel originate from Hyperdrive using the service token created above.

  1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Applications**.

  2. Select **Add an application**.

  3. Select **Self-hosted**.

  4. Enter any name for the application.

  5. In **Session Duration**, select `No duration, expires immediately`.

  6. Select **Add public hostname**. and enter the subdomain and domain that was previously set for the tunnel application.

  7. Select **Create new policy**.

  8. Enter a **Policy name** and set the **Action** to *Service Auth*.

  9. Create an **Include** rule. Specify a **Selector** of *Service Token* and the **Value** of the service token you created in step [2. Create a service token](#21-create-a-service-token).

  10. Save the policy.

  11. Go back to the application configuration and add the newly created Access policy.

  12. In **Login methods**, turn off *Accept all available identity providers* and clear all identity providers.

  13. Select **Next**.

  14. In **Application Appearance**, turn off **Show application in App Launcher**.

  15. Select **Next**.

  16. Select **Next**.

  17. Save the application.

  ### 2.3 Create a Hyperdrive configuration

  To create a Hyperdrive configuration for your private database, you'll need to specify the Access application and Cloudflare Tunnel information upon creation.

  * Wrangler

    ```sh
    # wrangler v3.65 and above required
    npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME-OF-HYPERDRIVE-CONFIGURATION-FOR-DB-VIA-TUNNEL> --host=<HOSTNAME-FOR-THE-TUNNEL> --user=<USERNAME-FOR-YOUR-DATABASE> --password=<PASSWORD-FOR-YOUR-DATABASE> --database=<DATABASE-TO-CONNECT-TO> --access-client-id=<YOUR-ACCESS-CLIENT-ID> --access-client-secret=<YOUR-SERVICE-TOKEN-CLIENT-SECRET>
    ```

  * Terraform

    ```terraform
    resource "cloudflare_hyperdrive_config"  "<TERRAFORM_VARIABLE_NAME_FOR_CONFIGURATION>" {
      account_id = "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>"
      name       = "<NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIGURATION>"
      origin     = {
        host     = "<HOSTNAME_OF_TUNNEL>"
        database = "<NAME_OF_DATABASE>"
        user     = "<NAME_OF_DATABASE_USER>"
        password = "<DATABASE_PASSWORD>"
        scheme   = "postgres"
        access_client_id     = "<ACCESS_CLIENT_ID>"
        access_client_secret = "<ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET>"
      }
      caching = {
        disabled = false
      }
    }
    ```

  This will create a Hyperdrive configuration using the usual database information (database name, database host, database user, and database password).

  In addition, it will also set the Access Client ID and the Access Client Secret of the Service Token. When Hyperdrive makes requests to the tunnel, requests will be intercepted by Access and validated using the credentials of the Service Token.

  Note

  When creating the Hyperdrive configuration for the private database, you must enter the `access-client-id` and the `access-client-id`, and omit the `port`. Hyperdrive will route database messages to the public hostname of the tunnel, and the tunnel will rely on its service configuration (as configured in [1.2. Connect your database using a public hostname](#12-connect-your-database-using-a-public-hostname)) to route requests to the database within your private network.

* Wrangler

  ```sh
  # wrangler v3.65 and above required
  npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME-OF-HYPERDRIVE-CONFIGURATION-FOR-DB-VIA-TUNNEL> --host=<HOSTNAME-FOR-THE-TUNNEL> --user=<USERNAME-FOR-YOUR-DATABASE> --password=<PASSWORD-FOR-YOUR-DATABASE> --database=<DATABASE-TO-CONNECT-TO> --access-client-id=<YOUR-ACCESS-CLIENT-ID> --access-client-secret=<YOUR-SERVICE-TOKEN-CLIENT-SECRET>
  ```

* Terraform

  ```terraform
  resource "cloudflare_hyperdrive_config"  "<TERRAFORM_VARIABLE_NAME_FOR_CONFIGURATION>" {
    account_id = "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    name       = "<NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIGURATION>"
    origin     = {
      host     = "<HOSTNAME_OF_TUNNEL>"
      database = "<NAME_OF_DATABASE>"
      user     = "<NAME_OF_DATABASE_USER>"
      password = "<DATABASE_PASSWORD>"
      scheme   = "postgres"
      access_client_id     = "<ACCESS_CLIENT_ID>"
      access_client_secret = "<ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET>"
    }
    caching = {
      disabled = false
    }
  }
  ```

## 3. Query your Hyperdrive configuration from a Worker (optional)

To test your Hyperdrive configuration to the database using Cloudflare Tunnel and Access, use the Hyperdrive configuration ID in your Worker and deploy it.

### Create a Hyperdrive binding

You must create a binding in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for your Worker to connect to your Hyperdrive configuration. [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to access resources, like Hyperdrive, on the Cloudflare developer platform.

To bind your Hyperdrive configuration to your Worker, add the following to the end of your Wrangler file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>" # the ID associated with the Hyperdrive you just created
  ```

Specifically:

* The value (string) you set for the `binding` (binding name) will be used to reference this database in your Worker. In this tutorial, name your binding `HYPERDRIVE`.
* The binding must be [a valid JavaScript variable name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables). For example, `binding = "hyperdrive"` or `binding = "productionDB"` would both be valid names for the binding.
* Your binding is available in your Worker at `env.<BINDING_NAME>`.

If you wish to use a local database during development, you can add a `localConnectionString` to your Hyperdrive configuration with the connection string of your database:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>",
        "localConnectionString": "<LOCAL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>" # the ID associated with the Hyperdrive you just created
  localConnectionString = "<LOCAL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI>"
  ```

Note

Learn more about setting up [Hyperdrive for local development](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/local-development/).

### Query your database

Validate that you can connect to your database from Workers and make queries.

* PostgreSQL

  Use Postgres.js to send a test query to validate that the connection has been successful.

  Install [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres):

  * npm

    ```sh
    npm i postgres@>3.4.5
    ```

  * yarn

    ```sh
    yarn add postgres@>3.4.5
    ```

  * pnpm

    ```sh
    pnpm add postgres@>3.4.5
    ```

  Note

  The minimum version of `postgres-js` required for Hyperdrive is `3.4.5`.

  Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

  * wrangler.jsonc

    ```jsonc
    {
      "compatibility_flags": [
        "nodejs_compat"
      ],
      "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
      "hyperdrive": [
        {
          "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
          "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  * wrangler.toml

    ```toml
    # required for database drivers to function
    compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
    compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


    [[hyperdrive]]
    binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
    id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
    ```

  Create a Worker that connects to your PostgreSQL database via Hyperdrive:

  ```ts
  // filepath: src/index.ts
  import postgres from "postgres";


  export default {
    async fetch(
      request: Request,
      env: Env,
      ctx: ExecutionContext,
    ): Promise<Response> {
      // Create a database client that connects to your database via Hyperdrive
      // using the Hyperdrive credentials
      const sql = postgres(env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString, {
        // Limit the connections for the Worker request to 5 due to Workers' limits on concurrent external connections
        max: 5,
        // If you are not using array types in your Postgres schema, disable `fetch_types` to avoid an additional round-trip (unnecessary latency)
        fetch_types: false,
      });


      try {
        // A very simple test query
        const result = await sql`select * from pg_tables`;


        // Clean up the client, ensuring we don't kill the worker before that is
        // completed.
        ctx.waitUntil(sql.end());


        // Return result rows as JSON
        return Response.json({ success: true, result: result });
      } catch (e: any) {
        console.error("Database error:", e.message);


        return Response.error();
      }
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
  ```

  Now, deploy your Worker:

  ```bash
  npx wrangler deploy
  ```

  If you successfully receive the list of `pg_tables` from your database when you access your deployed Worker, your Hyperdrive has now been configured to securely connect to a private database using [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) and [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/).

* MySQL

  Use [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) to send a test query to validate that the connection has been successful.

  Install the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

  * npm

    ```sh
    npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
    ```

  * yarn

    ```sh
    yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
    ```

  * pnpm

    ```sh
    pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
    ```

  Note

  `mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

  Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

  * wrangler.jsonc

    ```jsonc
    {
      "compatibility_flags": [
        "nodejs_compat"
      ],
      "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
      "hyperdrive": [
        {
          "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
          "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  * wrangler.toml

    ```toml
    # required for database drivers to function
    compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
    compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


    [[hyperdrive]]
    binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
    id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
    ```

  Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

  ```ts
  // mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
  import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";


  export default {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
      // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
      const connection = await createConnection({
        host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
        user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
        password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
        database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
        port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


        // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
        disableEval: true,
      });


      try {
        // Sample query
        const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");


        // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
        ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


        // Return result rows as JSON
        return Response.json({ results, fields });
      } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
      }
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
  ```

  Note

  The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

  Now, deploy your Worker:

  ```bash
  npx wrangler deploy
  ```

  If you successfully receive the list of tables from your database when you access your deployed Worker, your Hyperdrive has now been configured to securely connect to a private database using [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) and [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/).

Hyperdrive maintains a pool of connections to your database. These are optimally placed to minimize the latency for your applications. You can configure the amount of connections your Hyperdrive configuration uses to connect to your origin database. This enables you to right-size your connection pool based on your database capacity and application requirements.

For instance, if your Worker makes many queries to your database (which cannot be resolved by Hyperdrive's caching), you may want to allow Hyperdrive to make more connections to your database. Conversely, if your Worker makes few queries that actually need to reach your database or if your database allows a small number of database connections, you can reduce the amount of connections Hyperdrive will make to your database.

All configurations have a minimum of 5 connections, and with a maximum depending on your Workers plan. Refer to the [limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/limits/) for details.

## How Hyperdrive pools database connections

Hyperdrive will automatically scale the amount of database connections held open by Hyperdrive depending on your traffic and the amount of load that is put on your database.

The `max_size` parameter acts as a soft limit - Hyperdrive may temporarily create additional connections during network issues or high traffic periods to ensure high availability and resiliency.

## Best practices

You can configure connection counts using the Cloudflare dashboard or the Cloudflare API. Consider the following best practices to determine the right limit for your use-case:

* **Start conservatively**: Begin with a lower connection count and increase as needed based on your application's performance.
* **Monitor database metrics**: Watch your database's connection usage and performance metrics to optimize the connection count.
* **Consider database limits**: Ensure your configured connection count doesn't exceed your database's maximum connection limit.
* **Account for multiple configurations**: If you have multiple Hyperdrive configurations connecting to the same database, consider the total connection count across all configurations.

Hyperdrive uses the [Cloudflare IP address ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) to connect to your database. If you decide to restrict the IP addresses that can access your database with firewall rules, the IP address ranges listed in this reference need to be allow-listed in your database's firewall and networking configurations.

You can connect to your database from Hyperdrive using any of the 3 following networking configurations:

1. Configure your database to allow inbound connectivity from the public Internet (all IP address ranges).
2. Configure your database to allow inbound connectivity from the public Internet, with only the IP address ranges used by Hyperdrive allow-listed in an IP access control list (ACL).
3. Configure your database to allow inbound connectivity from a private network, and run a Cloudflare Tunnel instance in your private network to enable Hyperdrive to connect from the Cloudflare network to your private network.

title: How Hyperdrive works · Hyperdrive docs
description: Connecting to traditional centralized databases from Cloudflare's
  global network which consists of over 300 data center locations presents a few
  challenges as queries can originate from any of these locations.
lastUpdated: 2025-04-08T01:03:45.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false

---

Connecting to traditional centralized databases from Cloudflare's global network which consists of over [300 data center locations](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) presents a few challenges as queries can originate from any of these locations.

If your database is centrally located, queries can take a long time to get to the database and back. Queries can take even longer in situations where you have to establish a connection and make multiple round trips.

Traditional databases usually handle a maximum number of connections. With any reasonably large amount of distributed traffic, it becomes easy to exhaust these connections.

Hyperdrive solves these challenges by managing the number of global connections to your origin database, selectively parsing and choosing which query response to cache while reducing loading on your database and accelerating your database queries.

## How Hyperdrive makes databases fast globally

Hyperdrive accelerates database queries by:

* Performing the connection setup for new database connections near your Workers
* Pooling existing connections near your database
* Caching query results

This ensures you have optimal performance when connecting to your database from Workers (whether your queries are cached or not).

![Hyperdrive connection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/hyperdrive-comparison.BMT25nFH_fKr3G.svg)

### 1. Edge connection setup

When a database driver connects to a database from a Cloudflare Worker **directly**, it will first go through the connection setup. This may require multiple round trips to the database in order to verify and establish a secure connection. This can incur additional network latency due to the distance between your Cloudflare Worker and your database.

**With Hyperdrive**, this connection setup occurs between your Cloudflare Worker and Hyperdrive on the edge, as close to your Worker as possible (see diagram, label *1. Connection setup*). This incurs significantly less latency, since the connection setup is completed within the same location.

### 2. Connection Pooling

Hyperdrive creates a pool of connections to your database that can be reused as your application executes queries against your database.

The pool of database connections is placed in one or more regions closest to your origin database. This minimizes the latency incurred by roundtrips between your Cloudflare Workers and database to establish new connections. This also ensures that as little network latency is incurred for uncached queries.

If the connection pool has pre-existing connections, the connection pool will try and reuse that connection (see diagram, label *2. Existing warm connection*). If the connection pool does not have pre-existing connections, it will establish a new connection to your database and use that to route your query. This aims at reusing and creating the least number of connections possible as required to operate your application.

Note

Hyperdrive automatically manages the connection pool properties for you, including limiting the total number of connections to your origin database. Refer to [Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/limits/) to learn more.

### 3. Query Caching

Hyperdrive supports caching of non-mutating (read) queries to your database.

When queries are sent via Hyperdrive, Hyperdrive parses the query and determines whether the query is a mutating (write) or non-mutating (read) query.

For non-mutating queries, Hyperdrive will cache the response for the configured `max_age`, and whenever subsequent queries are made that match the original, Hyperdrive will return the cached response, bypassing the need to issue the query back to the origin database.

Caching reduces the burden on your origin database and accelerates the response times for your queries.

## Pooling mode

The Hyperdrive connection pooler operates in transaction mode, where the client that executes the query communicates through a single connection for the duration of a transaction. When that transaction has completed, the connection is returned to the pool.

Hyperdrive supports [`SET` statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set.html) for the duration of a transaction or a query. For instance, if you manually create a transaction with `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, `SET` statements within the transaction will take effect. Moreover, a query that includes a `SET` command (`SET X; SELECT foo FROM bar;`) will also apply the `SET` command. When a connection is returned to the pool, the connection is `RESET` such that the `SET` commands will not take effect on subsequent queries.

This implies that a single Worker invocation may obtain multiple connections to perform its database operations and may need to `SET` any configurations for every query or transaction. It is not recommended to wrap multiple database operations with a single transaction to maintain the `SET` state. Doing so will affect the performance and scaling of Hyperdrive as the connection cannot be reused by other Worker isolates for the duration of the transaction.

Hyperdrive supports named prepared statements as implemented in the `postgres.js` and `node-postgres` drivers. Named prepared statements in other drivers may have worse performance or may not be supported.

Hyperdrive can be used when developing and testing your Workers locally by connecting to a local database instance running on your machine directly, or a remote database instance. Local development uses [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), the command-line interface for Workers, to manage local development sessions and state.

Note

You can connect to a local database for local development using the local connection string configurations for Wrangler, as detailed below. This allows you to connect to a local database instance running on your machine directly.

You can also connect to a remote database for remote development using the `npx wrangler dev --remote` command, which will use the remote database configured for your Hyperdrive configuration.

## Configure local development

To specify a database to connect to when developing locally, you can:

* **Recommended:** Create a `WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_<BINDING_NAME>` [environmental variable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) with the connection string of your database. `<BINDING_NAME>` is the name of the binding assigned to your Hyperdrive in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) or Pages configuration. This allows you to avoid committing potentially sensitive credentials to source control in your Wrangler configuration file, if your test/development database is not ephemeral. If you have configured multiple Hyperdrive bindings, replace `<BINDING_NAME>` with the unique binding name for each.
* Set `localConnectionString` in the Wrangler configuration file.

If both the `WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_<BINDING_NAME>` [environmental variable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) and `localConnectionString` in the Wrangler configuration file are set, `wrangler dev` will use the environmental variable instead. Use `unset WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_<BINDING_NAME>` to unset any existing environmental variables.

For example, to use the environmental variable, export the environmental variable before running `wrangler dev`:

```sh
# Your configured Hyperdrive binding is "TEST_DB"
export WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_TEST_DB="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/databasename"
# Start a local development session referencing this local instance
npx wrangler dev
```

To configure a `localConnectionString` in the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/), ensure your Hyperdrive bindings have a `localConnectionString` property set:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "TEST_DB",
        "id": "c020574a-5623-407b-be0c-cd192bab9545",
        "localConnectionString": "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/databasename"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "TEST_DB"
  id = "c020574a-5623-407b-be0c-cd192bab9545"
  localConnectionString = "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/databasename"
  ```

## Use `wrangler dev`

The following example shows you how to check your wrangler version, set a `WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_TEST_DB` [environmental variable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/), and run a `wrangler dev` session:

```sh
# Confirm you are using wrangler v3.0+
npx wrangler --version
```

```sh
⛅️ wrangler 3.27.0
```

```sh
# Set your environmental variable: your configured Hyperdrive binding is "TEST_DB".
export WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_TEST_DB="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/databasename"
```

```sh
# Start a local dev session:
npx wrangler dev
```

```sh
------------------
Found a non-empty WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_TEST_DB variable. Hyperdrive will connect to this database
during local development.


wrangler dev now uses local mode by default, powered by 🔥 Miniflare and 👷 workerd.
To run an edge preview session for your Worker, use wrangler dev --remote
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- Hyperdrive configs:
  - TEST_DB: c020574a-5623-407b-be0c-cd192bab9545
⎔ Starting local server...


[mf:inf] Ready on http://127.0.0.1:8787/
[b] open a browser, [d] open Devtools, [l] turn off local mode, [c] clear console, [x] to exit
```

`wrangler dev` separates local and production (remote) data. A local session does not have access to your production data by default. To access your production (remote) Hyperdrive configuration, pass the `--remote` flag when calling `wrangler dev`. Any changes you make when running in `--remote` mode cannot be undone.

Refer to the [`wrangler dev` documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) to learn more about how to configure a local development session.

Hyperdrive automatically caches all cacheable queries executed against your database when query caching is turned on, reducing the need to go back to your database (incurring latency and database load) for every query which can be especially useful for popular queries. Query caching is enabled by default.

## What does Hyperdrive cache?

Because Hyperdrive uses database protocols, it can differentiate between a mutating query (a query that writes to the database) and a non-mutating query (a read-only query), allowing Hyperdrive to safely cache read-only queries.

Besides determining the difference between a `SELECT` and an `INSERT`, Hyperdrive also parses the database wire-protocol and uses it to differentiate between a mutating or non-mutating query.

For example, a read query that populates the front page of a news site would be cached:

* PostgreSQL

  ```sql
  -- Cacheable
  SELECT * FROM articles WHERE DATE(published_time) =
  CURRENT_DATE() ORDER BY published_time DESC LIMIT 50
  ```

* MySQL

  ```sql
  -- Cacheable
  SELECT * FROM articles WHERE DATE(published_time) =
  CURDATE() ORDER BY published_time DESC LIMIT 50
  ```

Mutating queries (including `INSERT`, `UPSERT`, or `CREATE TABLE`) and queries that use [functions designated as `volatile` by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-volatility.html) are not cached:

* PostgreSQL

  ```sql
  -- Not cached
  INSERT INTO users(id, name, email) VALUES(555, 'Matt', 'hello@example.com');


  SELECT LASTVAL(), * FROM articles LIMIT 50;
  ```

* MySQL

  ```sql
  -- Not cached
  INSERT INTO users(id, name, email) VALUES(555, 'Thomas', 'hello@example.com');


  SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID(), * FROM articles LIMIT 50;
  ```

## Default cache settings

The default caching behaviour for Hyperdrive is defined as below:

* `max_age` = 60 seconds (1 minute)
* `stale_while_revalidate` = 15 seconds

The `max_age` setting determines the maximum lifetime a query response will be served from cache. Cached responses may be evicted from the cache prior to this time if they are rarely used.

The `stale_while_revalidate` setting allows Hyperdrive to continue serving stale cache results for an additional period of time while it is revalidating the cache. In most cases, revalidation should happen rapidly.

You can set a maximum `max_age` of 1 hour.

## Disable caching

Disable caching on a per-Hyperdrive basis by using the [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) CLI to set the `--caching-disabled` option to `true`.

For example:

```sh
# wrangler v3.11 and above required
npx wrangler hyperdrive update my-hyperdrive-id --origin-password my-db-password --caching-disabled true
```

You can also configure multiple Hyperdrive connections from a single application: one connection that enables caching for popular queries, and a second connection where you do not want to cache queries, but still benefit from Hyperdrive's latency benefits and connection pooling.

For example, using database drivers:

* PostgreSQL

  ```ts
  const client = postgres(env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString);
  // ...
  const clientNoCache = postgres(env.HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED.connectionString);
  ```

* MySQL

  ```ts
  const connection = createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port
  });
  // ...
  const connectionNoCache = createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED.port
  });
  ```

The Wrangler configuration remains the same both for PostgreSQL and MySQL.

```jsonc
    {
      // Rest of file
      "hyperdrive": [
        {
          "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
          "id": "<YOUR_HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_ENABLED_CONFIGURATION_ID>"
        },
        {
          "binding": "HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED",
          "id": "<YOUR_HYPERDRIVE_CACHE_DISABLED_CONFIGURATION_ID>"
        }
      ]
    }
```

---

You can change the connection information and credentials of your Hyperdrive configuration in one of two ways:

1. Create a new Hyperdrive configuration with the new connection information, and update your Worker to use the new Hyperdrive configuration.
2. Update the existing Hyperdrive configuration with the new connection information and credentials.

## Use a new Hyperdrive configuration

Creating a new Hyperdrive configuration to update your database credentials allows you to keep your existing Hyperdrive configuration unchanged, gradually migrate your Worker to the new Hyperdrive configuration, and easily roll back to the previous configuration if needed.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration that connects to an existing PostgreSQL or MySQL database, use the [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) CLI or the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive).

```sh
# wrangler v3.11 and above required
npx wrangler hyperdrive create my-updated-hyperdrive --connection-string="<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```

The command above will output the ID of your Hyperdrive. Set this ID in the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for your Workers project:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

To update your Worker to use the new Hyperdrive configuration, redeploy your Worker or use [gradual deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/).

## Update the existing Hyperdrive configuration

You can update the configuration of an existing Hyperdrive configuration using the [wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

```sh
# wrangler v3.11 and above required
npx wrangler hyperdrive update <HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG_ID> --origin-host <YOUR_ORIGIN_HOST> --origin-password <YOUR_ORIGIN_PASSWORD> --origin-user <YOUR_ORIGIN_USERNAME> --database <YOUR_DATABASE> --origin-port <YOUR_ORIGIN_PORT>
```

Note

Updating the settings of an existing Hyperdrive configuration does not purge Hyperdrive's cache and does not tear down the existing database connection pool. New connections will be established using the new connection information.

  database. Hyperdrive supports:"

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/tls-ssl-certificates-for-hyperdrive/index.md
---

Hyperdrive provides additional ways to secure connectivity to your database. Hyperdrive supports:

1. **Server certificates** for TLS (SSL) modes such as `verify-ca` and `verify-full` for increased security. When configured, Hyperdrive will verify that the certificates have been signed by the expected certificate authority (CA) to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.
2. **Client certificates** for Hyperdrive to authenticate itself to your database with credentials beyond beyond username/password. To properly use client certificates, your database must be configured to verify the client certificates provided by a client, such as Hyperdrive, to allow access to the database.

Hyperdrive can be configured to use only server certificates, only client certificates, or both depending on your security requirements and database configurations.

Note

Support for server certificates and client certificates is not available for MySQL (beta). Support for server certificates and client certificates is only available for local development using `npx wrangler dev --remote` which runs your Workers and Hyperdrive in Cloudflare's network with local debugging.

## Server certificates (TLS/SSL modes)

Hyperdrive supports 3 common encryption [TLS/SSL modes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html) to connect to your database:

* `require` (default): TLS is required for encrypted connectivity and server certificates are validated (based on WebPKI).
* `verify-ca`: Hyperdrive will verify that the database server is trustworthy by verifying that the certificates of the server have been signed by the expected root certificate authority or intermediate certificate authority.
* `verify-full`: Identical to `verify-ca`, but Hyperdrive also requires the database hostname to match a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) present on the certificate.

By default, all Hyperdrive configurations are encrypted with SSL/TLS (`require`). This requires your database to be configured to accept encrypted connections (with SSL/TLS).

You can configure Hyperdrive to use `verify-ca` and `verify-full` for a more stringent security configuration, which provide additional verification checks of the server's certificates. This helps guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.

To configure Hyperdrive to verify the certificates of the server, you must provide Hyperdrive with the certificate of the root certificate authority (CA) or an intermediate certificate which has been used to sign the certificate of your database.

### Step 1: Upload your the root certificate authority (CA) certificate

Using Wrangler, you can upload your root certificate authority (CA) certificate:

```bash
# requires Wrangler 4.9.0 or greater
npx wrangler cert upload certificate-authority --ca-cert \<ROUTE_TO_CA_PEM_FILE\>.pem --name \<CUSTOM_NAME_FOR_CA_CERT\>


---


Uploading CA Certificate tmp-cert...
Success! Uploaded CA Certificate <CUSTOM_NAME_FOR_CA_CERT>
ID: <YOUR_ID_FOR_THE_CA_CERTIFICATE>
...
```

Note

You must use the CA certificate bundle that is for your specific region. You can not use a CA certificate bundle that contains more than one CA certificate, such as a global bundle of CA certificates containing each region's certificate.

### Step 2: Create your Hyperdrive configuration using the CA certificate and the SSL mode

Once your CA certificate has been created, you can create a Hyperdrive configuration with the newly created certificates using either the dashboard or Wrangler. You must also specify the SSL mode of `verify-ca` or `verify-full` to use.

* Wrangler

  Using Wrangler, enter the following command in your terminal to create a Hyperdrive configuration with the CA certificate and a `verify-full` SSL mode:

  ```bash
  npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name" --ca-certificate-id <YOUR_CA_CERT_ID> --sslmode verify-full
  ```

* Dashboard

  From the dashboard, follow these steps to create a Hyperdrive configuration with server certificates:

  1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive), navigate to **Storage & Databases > Hyperdrive** and click **Create configuration**.
  2. Select **Server certificates**.
  3. Specify a SSL mode of **Verify CA** or **Verify full**
  4. Select the SSL certificate of the certificate authority (CA) of your database that you have previously uploaded with Wrangler.

When creating the Hyperdrive configuration, Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to the database with the provided credentials. If the command provides successful results, you have properly configured your Hyperdrive configuration to verify the certificates provided by your database server.

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

## Client certificates

Your database can be configured to [verify a certificate provided by the client](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-CLIENTCERT), in this case, Hyperdrive. This serves as an additional factor to authenticate clients (in addition to the username and password).

For the database server to be able to verify the client certificates, Hyperdrive must be configured to provide a certificate file (`client-cert.pem`) and a private key with which the certificate was generated (`private-key.pem`).

### Step 1: Upload your client certificates (mTLS certificates)

Upload your client certificates to be used by Hyperdrive using Wrangler:

```bash
# requires Wrangler 4.9.0 or greater
npx wrangler cert upload mtls-certificate --cert client-cert.pem --key client-key.pem --name <CUSTOM_NAME_FOR_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE>


---


Uploading client certificate <CUSTOM_NAME_FOR_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE>...
Success! Uploaded client certificate <CUSTOM_NAME_FOR_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE>
ID: <YOUR_ID_FOR_THE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PAIR>
...
```

### Step 2: Create a Hyperdrive configuration

You can now create a Hyperdrive configuration using the newly created client certificate bundle using the dashboard or Wrangler.

* Wrangler

  Using Wrangler, enter the following command in your terminal to create a Hyperdrive configuration with using the client certificate pair:

  ```bash
  npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name" --mtls-certificate-id <YOUR_CLIENT_CERT_PAIR_ID>
  ```

* Dashboard

  From the dashboard, follow these steps to create a Hyperdrive configuration with server certificates:

  1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive), navigate to **Storage & Databases > Hyperdrive** and click **Create configuration**.
  2. Select **Client certificates**.
  3. Select the SSL client certificate and private key pair for Hyperdrive to use during the connection setup with your database server.

When Hyperdrive connects to your database, it will provide a client certificate signed with the private key to the database server. This allows the database server to confirm that the client, in this case Hyperdrive, has both the private key and the client certificate. By using client certificates, you can add an additional authentication layer for your database to ensures that only Hyperdrive can connect to it.

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

Hyperdrive supports MySQL and MySQL-compatible databases, [popular drivers](#supported-drivers), and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) libraries that use those drivers.

## Create a Hyperdrive

Note

New to Hyperdrive? Refer to the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/get-started/) to learn how to set up your first Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive that connects to an existing MySQL database, use the [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) CLI or the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive).

When using Wrangler, replace the placeholder value provided to `--connection-string` with the connection string for your database:

```sh
# wrangler v3.11 and above required
npx wrangler hyperdrive create my-first-hyperdrive --connection-string="mysql://user:password@database.host.example.com:3306/databasenamehere"
```

The command above will output the ID of your Hyperdrive, which you will need to set in the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for your Workers project:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

This will allow Hyperdrive to generate a dynamic connection string within your Worker that you can pass to your existing database driver. Refer to [Driver examples](#driver-examples) to learn how to set up a database driver with Hyperdrive.

Refer to the [Examples documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/) for step-by-step guides on how to set up Hyperdrive with several popular database providers.

## Supported drivers

Hyperdrive uses Workers [TCP socket support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/#connect) to support TCP connections to databases. The following table lists the supported database drivers and the minimum version that works with Hyperdrive:

| Driver | Documentation | Minimum Version Required | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| mysql2 (**recommended**) | [mysql2 documentation](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) | `mysql2@3.13.0` | Supported in both Workers & Pages. Using the Promise API is recommended. |
| mysql | [mysql documentation](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) | `mysql@2.18.0` | Requires `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]` and `compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"` - refer to [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs). Requires wrangler `3.78.7` or later. |
| Drizzle | [Drizzle documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/) | Requires `mysql2@3.13.0` | |
| Kysely | [Kysely documentation](https://kysely.dev/) | Requires `mysql2@3.13.0` | |

^ *The marked libraries can use either mysql or mysql2 as a dependency.*

Other drivers and ORMs not listed may also be supported: this list is not exhaustive.

### Database drivers and Node.js compatibility

[Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) is required for database drivers, including mysql and mysql2, and needs to be configured for your Workers project.

To enable both built-in runtime APIs and polyfills for your Worker or Pages project, add the [`nodejs_compat`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) [compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/), and set your compatibility date to September 23rd, 2024 or later. This will enable [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) for your Workers project.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23"
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
  ```

## Supported TLS (SSL) modes

Hyperdrive supports the following MySQL TLS/SSL connection modes when connecting to your origin database:

| Mode | Supported | Details |
| - | - | - |
| `DISABLED` | No | Hyperdrive does not support insecure plain text connections. |
| `PREFERRED` | No (use `required`) | Hyperdrive will always use TLS. |
| `REQUIRED` | Yes (default) | TLS is required, and server certificates are validated (based on WebPKI). |
| `VERIFY_CA` | Not currently supported in beta | Verifies the server's TLS certificate is signed by a root CA on the client. |
| `VERIFY_IDENTITY` | Not currently supported in beta | Identical to `VERIFY_CA`, but also requires that the database hostname matches the certificate's Common Name (CN). |

Note

Hyperdrive does not currently support `VERIFY_CA` or `VERIFY_IDENTITY` for MySQL (beta).

## Driver examples

The following examples show you how to:

1. Create a database client with a database driver.
2. Pass the Hyperdrive connection string and connect to the database.
3. Query your database via Hyperdrive.

### `mysql2`

The following Workers code shows you how to use [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) with Hyperdrive using the Promise API.

Install the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

Note

`mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
    const connection = await createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


      // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
      disableEval: true,
    });


    try {
      // Sample query
      const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ results, fields });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

### `mysql`

The following Workers code shows you how to use [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) with Hyperdrive.

Install the [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i mysql
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add mysql
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add mysql
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new connection and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
import { createConnection } from "mysql";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    const result = await new Promise<any>((resolve) => {
      // Create a connection using the mysql driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
      const connection = createConnection({
        host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
        user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
        password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
        database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
        port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,
      });


      connection.connect((error: { message: string }) => {
        if (error) {
          throw new Error(error.message);
        }


        // Sample query
        connection.query("SHOW tables;", [], (error, rows, fields) => {
          connection.end();


          resolve({ fields, rows });
        });
      });
    });


    // Return result  as JSON
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Identify connections from Hyperdrive

To identify active connections to your MySQL database server from Hyperdrive:

* Hyperdrive's connections to your database will show up with `Cloudflare Hyperdrive` in the `PROGRAM_NAME` column in the `performance_schema.threads` table.
* Run `SELECT DISTINCT USER, HOST, PROGRAM_NAME FROM performance_schema.threads WHERE PROGRAM_NAME = 'Cloudflare Hyperdrive'` to show whether Hyperdrive is currently holding a connection (or connections) open to your database.

## Next steps

* Refer to the list of [supported database integrations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/connecting-to-databases/) to understand other ways to connect to existing databases.
* Learn more about how to use the [Socket API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets) in a Worker.
* Understand the [protocols supported by Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/protocols/).

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.

### Postgres.js

The following Workers code shows you how to use [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) with Hyperdrive.

Install [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres):

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i postgres@>3.4.5
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add postgres@>3.4.5
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add postgres@>3.4.5
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `postgres-js` required for Hyperdrive is `3.4.5`.

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a Worker that connects to your PostgreSQL database via Hyperdrive:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import postgres from "postgres";


export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext,
  ): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a database client that connects to your database via Hyperdrive
    // using the Hyperdrive credentials
    const sql = postgres(env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString, {
      // Limit the connections for the Worker request to 5 due to Workers' limits on concurrent external connections
      max: 5,
      // If you are not using array types in your Postgres schema, disable `fetch_types` to avoid an additional round-trip (unnecessary latency)
      fetch_types: false,
    });


    try {
      // A very simple test query
      const result = await sql`select * from pg_tables`;


      // Clean up the client, ensuring we don't kill the worker before that is
      // completed.
      ctx.waitUntil(sql.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ success: true, result: result });
    } catch (e: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", e.message);


      return Response.error();
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Identify connections from Hyperdrive

To identify active connections to your Postgres database server from Hyperdrive:

* Hyperdrive's connections to your database will show up with `Cloudflare Hyperdrive` as the `application_name` in the `pg_stat_activity` table.
* Run `SELECT DISTINCT usename, application_name FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE application_name = 'Cloudflare Hyperdrive'` to show whether Hyperdrive is currently holding a connection (or connections) open to your database.

## Next steps

* Refer to the list of [supported database integrations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/connecting-to-databases/) to understand other ways to connect to existing databases.
* Learn more about how to use the [Socket API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets) in a Worker.
* Understand the [protocols supported by Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/protocols/).

Hyperdrive exposes analytics that allow you to inspect query volume, query latency and cache ratios size across all and/or each Hyperdrive configuration in your account.

## Metrics

Hyperdrive currently exports the below metrics as part of the `hyperdriveQueriesAdaptiveGroups` GraphQL dataset:

| Metric | GraphQL Field Name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Queries | `count` | The number of queries issued against your Hyperdrive in the given time period. |
| Cache Status | `cacheStatus` | Whether the query was cached or not. Can be one of `disabled`, `hit`, `miss`, `uncacheable`, `multiplestatements`, `notaquery`, `oversizedquery`, `oversizedresult`, `parseerror`, `transaction`, and `volatile`. |
| Query Bytes | `queryBytes` | The size of your queries, in bytes. |
| Result Bytes | `resultBytes` | The size of your query *results*, in bytes. |
| Connection Latency | `connectionLatency` | The time (in milliseconds) required to establish new connections from Hyperdrive to your database, as measured from your Hyperdrive connection pool(s). |
| Query Latency | `queryLatency` | The time (in milliseconds) required to query (and receive results) from your database, as measured from your Hyperdrive connection pool(s). |
| Event Status | `eventStatus` | Whether a query responded successfully (`complete`) or failed (`error`). |

Metrics can be queried (and are retained) for the past 31 days.

## View metrics in the dashboard

Per-database analytics for Hyperdrive are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics for a Hyperdrive configuration:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to [**Workers & Pages** > **Hyperdrive**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive).
3. Select an existing Hyperdrive configuration.
4. Select the **Metrics** tab.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your Hyperdrive configurations via the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same datasets as the Cloudflare dashboard, and supports GraphQL [introspection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

Hyperdrives's GraphQL datasets require an `accountTag` filter with your Cloudflare account ID. Hyperdrive exposes the `hyperdriveQueriesAdaptiveGroups` dataset.

## Write GraphQL queries

Examples of how to explore your Hyperdrive metrics.

### Get the number of queries handled via your Hyperdrive config by cache status

```graphql
query HyperdriveQueries(
  $accountTag: string!
  $configId: string!
  $datetimeStart: Time!
  $datetimeEnd: Time!
) {
  viewer {
    accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
      hyperdriveQueriesAdaptiveGroups(
        limit: 10000
        filter: {
          configId: $configId
          datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
          datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
        }
      ) {
        count
        dimensions {
          cacheStatus
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

title: Troubleshoot and debug · Hyperdrive docs
description: Troubleshoot and debug errors commonly associated with connecting
  to a database with Hyperdrive.

Troubleshoot and debug errors commonly associated with connecting to a database with Hyperdrive.

## Configuration errors

When creating a new Hyperdrive configuration, or updating the connection parameters associated with an existing configuration, Hyperdrive performs a test connection to your database in the background before creating or updating the configuration.

Hyperdrive will also issue an empty test query, a `;` in PostgreSQL, to validate that it can pass queries to your database.

| Error Code | Details | Recommended fixes |
| - | - | - |
| `2008` | Bad hostname. | Hyperdrive could not resolve the database hostname. Confirm it exists in public DNS. |
| `2009` | The hostname does not resolve to a public IP address, or the IP address is not a public address. | Hyperdrive can only connect to public IP addresses. Private IP addresses, like `10.1.5.0` or `192.168.2.1`, are not currently supported. |
| `2010` | Cannot connect to the host:port. | Hyperdrive could not route to the hostname: ensure it has a public DNS record that resolves to a public IP address. Check that the hostname is not misspelled. |
| `2011` | Connection refused. | A network firewall or access control list (ACL) is likely rejecting requests from Hyperdrive. Ensure you have allowed connections from the public Internet. |
| `2012` | TLS (SSL) not supported by the database. | Hyperdrive requires TLS (SSL) to connect. Configure TLS on your database. |
| `2013` | Invalid database credentials. | Ensure your username is correct (and exists), and the password is correct (case-sensitive). |
| `2014` | The specified database name does not exist. | Check that the database (not table) name you provided exists on the database you are asking Hyperdrive to connect to. |
| `2015` | Generic error. | Hyperdrive failed to connect and could not determine a reason. Open a support ticket so Cloudflare can investigate. |
| `2016` | Test query failed. | Confirm that the user Hyperdrive is connecting as has permissions to issue read and write queries to the given database. |

### Failure to connect

Hyperdrive may also emit `Failed to connect to the provided database` when it fails to connect to the database when attempting to create a Hyperdrive configuration. This is possible when the TLS (SSL) certificates are misconfigured. Here is a non-exhaustive table of potential failure to connect errors:

| Error message | Details | Recommended fixes |
| - | - | - |
| Server return error and closed connection. | This message occurs when you attempt to connect to a database that has client certificate verification enabled. | Ensure you are configuring your Hyperdrive with [client certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/tls-ssl-certificates-for-hyperdrive/) if your database requires them. |
| TLS handshake failed: cert validation failed. | This message occurs when Hyperdrive has been configured with server CA certificates and is indicating that the certificate provided by the server has not been signed by the expected CA certificate. | Ensure you are using the expected the correct CA certificate for Hyperdrive, or ensure you are connecting to the right database. |

## Connection errors

Hyperdrive may also return errors at runtime. This can happen during initial connection setup, or in response to a query or other wire-protocol command sent by your driver.

These errors are returned as `ErrorResponse` wire protocol messages, which are handled by most drivers by throwing from the responsible query or by triggering an error event. Hyperdrive errors that do not map 1:1 with an error message code [documented by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html) use the `58000` error code.

Hyperdrive may also encounter `ErrorResponse` wire protocol messages sent by your database. Hyperdrive will pass these errors through unchanged when possible.

### Hyperdrive specific errors

| Error Message | Details | Recommended fixes |
| - | - | - |
| `Internal error.` | Something is broken on our side. | Check for an ongoing incident affecting Hyperdrive, and contact Cloudflare Support. Retrying the query is appropriate, if it makes sense for your usage pattern. |
| `Failed to acquire a connection from the pool.` | Hyperdrive timed out while waiting for a connection to your database, or cannot connect at all. | If you are seeing this error intermittently, your Hyperdrive pool is being exhausted because too many connections are being held open for too long by your worker. This can be caused by a myriad of different issues, but long-running queries/transactions are a common offender. |
| `Server connection attempt failed: connection_refused` | Hyperdrive is unable to create new connections to your origin database. | A network firewall or access control list (ACL) is likely rejecting requests from Hyperdrive. Ensure you have allowed connections from the public Internet. Sometimes, this can be caused by your database host provider refusing incoming connections when you go over your connection limit. |
| `Hyperdrive does not currently support MySQL COM_STMT_PREPARE messages` | Hyperdrive does not support prepared statements for MySQL databases. | Remove prepared statements from your MySQL queries. |

### Node errors

| Error Message | Details | Recommended fixes |
| - | - | - |
| `Uncaught Error: No such module "node:<module>"` | Your Cloudflare Workers project or a library that it imports is trying to access a Node module that is not available. | Enable [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) for your Cloudflare Workers project to maximize compatibility. |

### Driver errors

If your queries are not getting cached despite Hyperdrive having caching enabled, your driver may be configured such that your queries are not cacheable by Hyperdrive. This may happen if you are using the [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) driver with [`prepare: false:`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres?tab=readme-ov-file#prepared-statements). To resolve this, enable prepared statements with `prepare: true`.

| Error Message | Details | Recommended fixes |
| - | - | - |
| `Code generation from strings disallowed for this context` | The database driver you are using is attempting to use the `eval()` command, which is unsupported on Cloudflare Workers (common in `mysql2` driver). | Configure the database driver to not use `eval()`. See how to [configure `mysql2` to disable the usage of `eval()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-mysql/mysql-drivers-and-libraries/mysql2/). |

### Improve performance

Having query traffic written as transactions can limit performance. This is because in the case of a transaction, the connection must be held for the duration of the transaction, which limits connection multiplexing. If there are multiple queries per transaction, this can be particularly impactful on connection multiplexing. Where possible, we recommend not wrapping queries in transactions to allow the connections to be shared more aggressively.

The following limits apply to Hyperdrive configuration, connections, and queries made to your configured origin databases.

| Feature | Free | Paid |
| - | - | - |
| Maximum configured databases | 10 per account | 25 per account |
| Initial connection timeout | 15 seconds | 15 seconds |
| Idle connection timeout | 10 minutes | 10 minutes |
| Maximum cached query response size | 50 MB | 50 MB |
| Maximum query (statement) duration | 60 seconds | 60 seconds |
| Maximum username length [1](#user-content-fn-1) | 63 characters (bytes) | 63 characters (bytes) |
| Maximum database name length [1](#user-content-fn-1) | 63 characters (bytes) | 63 characters (bytes) |
| Maximum potential origin database connections [2](#user-content-fn-2) | approx. \~20 connections | approx. \~100 connections |

Note

Hyperdrive does not have a hard limit on the number of concurrent *client* connections made from your Workers.

As many hosted databases have limits on the number of unique connections they can manage, Hyperdrive attempts to keep number of concurrent pooled connections to your origin database lower.

Note

You can request adjustments to limits that conflict with your project goals by contacting Cloudflare. Not all limits can be increased. To request an increase, submit a [Limit Increase Request](https://forms.gle/ukpeZVLWLnKeixDu7) and we will contact you with next steps. We also regularly monitor the Hyperdrive channel in [Cloudflare's Discord community](https://discord.cloudflare.com/) and can answer questions regarding limits and requests.

## Footnotes

1. This is a limit enforced by PostgreSQL. Some database providers may enforce smaller limits. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1) [↩2](#user-content-fnref-1-2)

2. Hyperdrive is a distributed system, so it is possible for a client to be unable to reach an existing pool. In this scenario, a new pool will be established, with its own allocation of connections. This favors availability over strictly enforcing limits, but does mean that it is possible in edge cases to overshoot the normal connection limit. [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)

## 2025-07-03

**Hyperdrive now supports configurable connection counts**

Hyperdrive configurations can now be set to use a specific number of connections to your origin database. There is a minimum of 5 connections for all configurations and a maximum according to your [Workers plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/limits/).

This limit is a soft maximum. Hyperdrive may make more than this amount of connections in the event of unexpected networking issues in order to ensure high availability and resiliency.

## 2025-05-05

**Hyperdrive improves regional caching for prepared statements for faster cache hits**

Hyperdrive now better caches prepared statements closer to your Workers. This results in up to 5x faster cache hits by reducing the roundtrips needed between your Worker and Hyperdrive's connection pool.

## 2025-03-07

**Hyperdrive connects to your database using Cloudflare's IP address ranges**

Hyperdrive now uses [Cloudflare's IP address ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) for egress.

This enables you to configure the firewall policies on your database to allow access to this limited IP address range.

Learn more about [configuring your database networking for Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/firewall-and-networking-configuration/).

## 2025-03-07

**Hyperdrive improves connection pool placement, decreasing query latency by up to 90%**

Hyperdrive now pools all database connections in one or more regions as close to your database as possible. This means that your uncached queries and new database connections have up to 90% less latency as measured from Hyperdrive connection pools.

With improved placement for Hyperdrive connection pools, Workers' Smart Placement is more effective by ensuring that your Worker and Hyperdrive database connection pool are placed as close to your database as possible.

See [the announcement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-03-04-hyperdrive-pooling-near-database-and-ip-range-egress/) for more details.

**Hyperdrive automatically configures your Cloudflare Tunnel to connect to your private database.**

When creating a Hyperdrive configuration for a private database, you only need to provide your database credentials and set up a Cloudflare Tunnel within the private network where your database is accessible.

Hyperdrive will automatically create the Cloudflare Access, Service Token and Policies needed to secure and restrict your Cloudflare Tunnel to the Hyperdrive configuration.

Refer to [documentation on how to configure Hyperdrive to connect to a private database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

## 2024-12-11

**Hyperdrive now caches queries in all Cloudflare locations decreasing cache hit latency by up to 90%**

Hyperdrive query caching now happens in all locations where Hyperdrive can be accessed. When making a query in a location that has cached the query result, your latency may be decreased by up to 90%.

Refer to [documentation on how Hyperdrive caches query results](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/how-hyperdrive-works/#query-caching).

## 2024-11-19

**Hyperdrive now supports clear-text password authentication**

When connecting to a database that requires secure clear-text password authentication over TLS, Hyperdrive will now support this authentication method.

Refer to the documentation to see [all PostgreSQL authentication modes supported by Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/reference/supported-databases-and-features#supported-postgresql-authentication-modes).

## 2024-10-30

**New Hyperdrive configurations to private databases using Tunnels are validated before creation**

When creating a new Hyperdrive configuration to a private database using Tunnels, Hyperdrive will verify that it can connect to the database to ensure that your Tunnel and Access application have been properly configured. This makes it easier to debug connectivity issues.

Refer to [documentation on connecting to private databases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/) for more information.

## 2024-09-20

**The \`node-postgres\` (pg) driver is now supported for Pages applications using Hyperdrive.**

The popular `pg` ([node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) driver no longer requires the legacy `node_compat` mode, and can now be used in both Workers and Pages for connecting to Hyperdrive. This uses the new (improved) Node.js compatibility in Workers and Pages.

You can set [`compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat_v2"]`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) in your `wrangler.toml` or via the Pages dashboard to benefit from this change. Visit the [Hyperdrive documentation on supported drivers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/#supported-drivers) to learn more about the driver versions supported by Hyperdrive.

## 2024-08-19

**Improved caching for Postgres.js**

Hyperdrive now better caches [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) queries to reduce queries to the origin database.

## 2024-08-13

**Hyperdrive audit logs now available in the Cloudflare Dashboard**

Actions that affect Hyperdrive configs in an account will now appear in the audit logs for that account.

## 2024-05-24

**Increased configuration limits**

You can now create up to 25 Hyperdrive configurations per account, up from the previous maximum of 10.

Refer to [Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/limits/) to review the limits that apply to Hyperdrive.

## 2024-05-22

**Driver performance improvements**

Compatibility improvements to how Hyperdrive interoperates with the popular [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) driver have been released. These improvements allow queries made via Postgres.js to be correctly cached (when enabled) in Hyperdrive.

Developers who had previously set `prepare: false` can remove this configuration when establishing a new Postgres.js client instance.

Read the [documentation on supported drivers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/#supported-drivers) to learn more about database driver interoperability with Hyperdrive.

Below you will find answers to our most commonly asked questions regarding Hyperdrive.

## Connectivity

### Does Hyperdrive use specific IP addresses to connect to my database?

Hyperdrive connects to your database using [Cloudflare's IP address ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/). These are shared by all Hyperdrive configurations and other Cloudflare products.

You can use this to configure restrictions in your database firewall to restrict the IP addresses that can access your database.

### Does Hyperdrive support connecting to D1 databases?

Hyperdrive does not support [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1) because D1 provides fast connectivity from Workers by design.

Hyperdrive is designed to speed up connectivity to traditional, regional SQL databases such as PostgreSQL. These databases are typically accessed using database drivers that communicate over TCP/IP. Unlike D1, creating a secure database connection to a traditional SQL database involves multiple round trips between the client (your Worker) and your database server. See [How Hyperdrive works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/how-hyperdrive-works/) for more detail on why round trips are needed and how Hyperdrive solves this.

D1 does not require round trips to create database connections. D1 is designed to be performant for access from Workers by default, without needing Hyperdrive.

## Pricing

### Does Hyperdrive charge for data transfer / egress?

No.

### Is Hyperdrive available on the [Workers Free](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) plan?

Yes. Refer to [pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/pricing/).

### Does Hyperdrive charge for additional compute?

Hyperdrive itself does not charge for compute (CPU) or processing (wall clock) time. Workers querying Hyperdrive and computing results: for example, serializing results into JSON and/or issuing queries, are billed per [Workers pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/#workers).

## Limits

### Are there any limits to Hyperdrive?

Refer to the published [limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/limits/) documentation.

| `prefer` | No (use `require`) | Hyperdrive will always use TLS. |
| `require` | Yes (default) | TLS is required, and server certificates are validated (based on WebPKI). |
| `verify-ca` | Yes | Verifies the server's TLS certificate is signed by a root CA on the client. This ensures the server has a certificate the client trusts. |
| `verify-full` | Yes | Identical to `verify-ca`, but also requires the database hostname must match a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) present on the certificate. |

Refer to [SSL/TLS certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/tls-ssl-certificates-for-hyperdrive/) documentation for details on how to configure `verify-ca` or `verify-full` TLS (SSL) modes for Hyperdrive.

Note

Hyperdrive support for `verify-ca` and `verify-full` is not available for MySQL (beta).

## Supported PostgreSQL authentication modes

Hyperdrive supports the following [authentication modes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html) for connecting to PostgreSQL databases:

* Password Authentication (`md5`)
* Password Authentication (`password`) (clear-text password)
* SASL Authentication (`SCRAM-SHA-256`)

## Unsupported PostgreSQL features:

Hyperdrive does not support the following PostgreSQL features:

* SQL-level management of prepared statements, such as using `PREPARE`, `DISCARD`, `DEALLOCATE`, or `EXECUTE`.
* Advisory locks ([PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS)).
* `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY`.
* `PREPARE` and `DEALLOCATE`.
* Any modification to per-session state not explicitly documented as supported elsewhere.

title: Create a serverless, globally distributed time-series API with Timescale
  · Hyperdrive docs
description: In this tutorial, you will learn to build an API on Workers which
  will ingest and query time-series data stored in Timescale (they make
  PostgreSQL faster in the cloud).

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/tutorials/serverless-timeseries-api-with-timescale/index.md
---

In this tutorial, you will learn to build an API on Workers which will ingest and query time-series data stored in [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/) (they make PostgreSQL faster in the cloud).

You will create and deploy a Worker function that exposes API routes for ingesting data, and use [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/) to proxy your database connection from the edge and maintain a connection pool to prevent us having to make a new database connection on every request.

You will learn how to:

* Build and deploy a Cloudflare Worker.
* Use Worker secrets with the Wrangler CLI.
* Deploy a Timescale database service.
* Connect your Worker to your Timescale database service with Hyperdrive.
* Query your new API.

You can learn more about Timescale by reading their [documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/latest/services/).

***

## 1. Create a Worker project

Run the following command to create a Worker project from the command line:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- timescale-api
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare timescale-api
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest timescale-api
  ```

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `TypeScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

Make note of the URL that your application was deployed to. You will be using it when you configure your GitHub webhook.

Change into the directory you just created for your Worker project:

```sh
cd timescale-api
```

## 2. Prepare your Timescale Service

Note

If you have not signed up for Timescale, go to the [signup page](https://timescale.com/signup) where you can start a free 30 day trial with no credit card.

If you are creating a new service, go to the [Timescale Console](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/) and follow these steps:

1. Select **Create Service** by selecting the black plus in the upper right.
2. Choose **Time Series** as the service type.
3. Choose your desired region and instance size. 1 CPU will be enough for this tutorial.
4. Set a service name to replace the randomly generated one.
5. Select **Create Service**.
6. On the right hand side, expand the **Connection Info** dialog and copy the **Service URL**.
7. Copy the password which is displayed. You will not be able to retrieve this again.
8. Select **I stored my password, go to service overview**.

If you are using a service you created previously, you can retrieve your service connection information in the [Timescale Console](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/):

1. Select the service (database) you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Expand **Connection info**.
3. Copy the **Service URL**. The Service URL is the connection string that Hyperdrive will use to connect. This string includes the database hostname, port number and database name.

Note

If you do not have your password stored, you will need to select **Forgot your password?** and set a new **SCRAM** password. Save this password, as Timescale will only display it once.

You should ensure that you do not break any existing clients if when you reset the password.

Insert your password into the **Service URL** as follows (leaving the portion after the @ untouched):

```txt
postgres://tsdbadmin:YOURPASSWORD@...
```

This will be referred to as **SERVICEURL** in the following sections.

## 3. Create your Hypertable

Timescale allows you to convert regular PostgreSQL tables into [hypertables](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/hypertables/), tables used to deal with time-series, events, or analytics data. Once you have made this change, Timescale will seamlessly manage the hypertable's partitioning, as well as allow you to apply other features like compression or continuous aggregates.

Connect to your Timescale database using the Service URL you copied in the last step (it has the password embedded).

If you are using the default PostgreSQL CLI tool [**psql**](https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-to-install-psql-on-mac-ubuntu-debian-windows/) to connect, you would run psql like below (substituting your **Service URL** from the previous step). You could also connect using a graphical tool like [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

```sh
psql <SERVICEURL>
```

Once you are connected, create your table by pasting the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE readings(
  ts timestamptz DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  sensor UUID NOT NULL,
  metadata jsonb,
  value numeric NOT NULL
 );


SELECT create_hypertable('readings', 'ts');
```

Timescale will manage the rest for you as you ingest and query data.

## 4. Create a database configuration

To create a new Hyperdrive instance you will need:

* Your **SERVICEURL** from [step 2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/tutorials/serverless-timeseries-api-with-timescale/#2-prepare-your-timescale-service).
* A name for your Hyperdrive service. For this tutorial, you will use **hyperdrive**.

Hyperdrive uses the `create` command with the `--connection-string` argument to pass this information. Run it as follows:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create hyperdrive --connection-string="SERVICEURL"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs your Hyperdrive ID. You can now bind your Hyperdrive configuration to your Worker in your Wrangler configuration by replacing the content with the following:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "timescale-api",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "your-id-here"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "timescale-api"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
  compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat"]


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "your-id-here"
  ```

Install the Postgres driver into your Worker project:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg
  ```

Now copy the below Worker code, and replace the current code in `./src/index.ts`. The code below:

1. Uses Hyperdrive to connect to Timescale using the connection string generated from `env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString` directly to the driver.
2. Creates a `POST` route which accepts an array of JSON readings to insert into Timescale in one transaction.
3. Creates a `GET` route which takes a `limit` parameter and returns the most recent readings. This could be adapted to filter by ID or by timestamp.

```ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export interface Env {
  HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });
    await client.connect();


    const url = new URL(request.url);
    // Create a route for inserting JSON as readings
    if (request.method === "POST" && url.pathname === "/readings") {
      // Parse the request's JSON payload
      const productData = await request.json();


      // Write the raw query. You are using jsonb_to_recordset to expand the JSON
      // to PG INSERT format to insert all items at once, and using coalesce to
      // insert with the current timestamp if no ts field exists
      const insertQuery = `
      INSERT INTO readings (ts, sensor, metadata, value)
      SELECT coalesce(ts, now()), sensor, metadata, value FROM jsonb_to_recordset($1::jsonb)
      AS t(ts timestamptz, sensor UUID, metadata jsonb, value numeric)
  `;


      const insertResult = await client.query(insertQuery, [
        JSON.stringify(productData),
      ]);


      // Collect the raw row count inserted to return
      const resp = new Response(JSON.stringify(insertResult.rowCount), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });


      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());
      return resp;


      // Create a route for querying within a time-frame
    } else if (request.method === "GET" && url.pathname === "/readings") {
      const limit = url.searchParams.get("limit");


      // Query the readings table using the limit param passed
      const result = await client.query(
        "SELECT * FROM readings ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT $1",
        [limit],
      );


      // Return the result as JSON
      const resp = new Response(JSON.stringify(result.rows), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });


      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());
      return resp;
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## 5. Deploy your Worker

Run the following command to redeploy your Worker:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Your application is now live and accessible at `timescale-api.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`. The exact URI will be shown in the output of the wrangler command you just ran.

After deploying, you can interact with your Timescale IoT readings database using your Cloudflare Worker. Connection from the edge will be faster because you are using Cloudflare Hyperdrive to connect from the edge.

You can now use your Cloudflare Worker to insert new rows into the `readings` table. To test this functionality, send a `POST` request to your Worker’s URL with the `/readings` path, along with a JSON payload containing the new product data:

```json
[
  { "sensor": "6f3e43a4-d1c1-4cb6-b928-0ac0efaf84a5", "value": 0.3 },
  { "sensor": "d538f9fa-f6de-46e5-9fa2-d7ee9a0f0a68", "value": 10.8 },
  { "sensor": "5cb674a0-460d-4c80-8113-28927f658f5f", "value": 18.8 },
  { "sensor": "03307bae-d5b8-42ad-8f17-1c810e0fbe63", "value": 20.0 },
  { "sensor": "64494acc-4aa5-413c-bd09-2e5b3ece8ad7", "value": 13.1 },
  { "sensor": "0a361f03-d7ec-4e61-822f-2857b52b74b3", "value": 1.1 },
  { "sensor": "50f91cdc-fd19-40d2-b2b0-c90db3394981", "value": 10.3 }
]
```

This tutorial omits the `ts` (the timestamp) and `metadata` (the JSON blob) so they will be set to `now()` and `NULL` respectively.

Once you have sent the `POST` request you can also issue a `GET` request to your Worker’s URL with the `/readings` path. Set the `limit` parameter to control the amount of returned records.

If you have **curl** installed you can test with the following commands (replace `<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>` with your subdomain from the deploy command above):

```bash
curl --request POST --data @- 'https://timescale-api.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/readings' <<EOF
[
  { "sensor": "6f3e43a4-d1c1-4cb6-b928-0ac0efaf84a5", "value":0.3},
  { "sensor": "d538f9fa-f6de-46e5-9fa2-d7ee9a0f0a68", "value":10.8},
  { "sensor": "5cb674a0-460d-4c80-8113-28927f658f5f", "value":18.8},
  { "sensor": "03307bae-d5b8-42ad-8f17-1c810e0fbe63", "value":20.0},
  { "sensor": "64494acc-4aa5-413c-bd09-2e5b3ece8ad7", "value":13.1},
  { "sensor": "0a361f03-d7ec-4e61-822f-2857b52b74b3", "value":1.1},
  { "sensor": "50f91cdc-fd19-40d2-b2b0-c90db3394981", "metadata": {"color": "blue" }, "value":10.3}
]
EOF
```

```sh
curl "https://timescale-api.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/readings?limit=10"
```

description: Connect Hyperdrive to an AWS RDS database instance.
lastUpdated: 2025-05-12T14:16:48.000Z

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) or Amazon Aurora MySQL database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

Note

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you must allow Cloudflare IPs to be able to access your database. You can either allow-list all IP address ranges (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255) or restrict your IP access control list to the [IP ranges used by Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/firewall-and-networking-configuration/).

Alternatively, you can connect to your databases over in your private network using [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

### AWS Console

When creating or modifying an instance in the AWS console:

1. Configure a **database cluster** and other settings you wish to customize.
2. Under **Settings** > **Credential settings**, note down the **Master username** and **Master password** (Aurora only).
3. Under the **Connectivity** header, ensure **Public access** is set to **Yes**.
4. Select an **Existing VPC security group** that allows public Internet access from `0.0.0.0/0` to the port your database instance is configured to listen on (default: `5432` for PostgreSQL instances).
5. Select **Create database**.

Warning

You must ensure that the [VPC security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html) associated with your database allows public IPv4 access to your database port.

Refer to AWS' [database server rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules-reference.html#sg-rules-db-server) for details on how to configure rules specific to your RDS database.

### Retrieve the database endpoint (Aurora)

To retrieve the database endpoint (hostname) for Hyperdrive to connect to:

1. Go to **Databases** view under **RDS** in the AWS console.
2. Select the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
3. Under the **Endpoints** header, note down the **Endpoint name** with the type `Writer` and the **Port**.

### Retrieve the database endpoint (RDS MySQL)

For regular RDS instances (non-Aurora), you will need to fetch the endpoint and port of the database:

1. Go to **Databases** view under **RDS** in the AWS console.
2. Select the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
3. Under the **Connectivity & security** header, note down the **Endpoint** and the **Port**.

The endpoint will resemble `YOUR_DATABASE_NAME.cpuo5rlli58m.AWS_REGION.rds.amazonaws.com`, and the port will default to `3306`.

Support for MySQL-compatible providers

Support for AWS Aurora MySQL databases is coming soon. Join our early preview support by reaching out to us in the [Hyperdrive Discord channel](https://discord.cloudflare.com/).

## 2. Create your user

Once your database is created, you will need to create a user for Hyperdrive to connect as. Although you can use the **Master username** configured during initial database creation, best practice is to create a less privileged user.

To create a new user, log in to the database and use the `CREATE ROLE` command:

```sh
# Log in to the database
psql postgresql://MASTER_USERNAME:MASTER_PASSWORD@ENDPOINT_NAME:PORT/database_name
```

Run the following SQL statements:

```sql
-- Create a role for Hyperdrive
CREATE ROLE hyperdrive;


-- Allow Hyperdrive to connect
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO hyperdrive;


-- Grant database privileges to the hyperdrive role
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE postgres to hyperdrive;


-- Create a specific user for Hyperdrive to log in as
CREATE ROLE hyperdrive_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'sufficientlyRandomPassword';


-- Grant this new user the hyperdrive role privileges
GRANT hyperdrive to hyperdrive_user;
```

Refer to AWS' [documentation on user roles in PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.Roles.html) for more details.

With a database user, password, database endpoint (hostname and port), and database name (default: `postgres`), you can now set up Hyperdrive.

## 3. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `mysql`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command.

* Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or,
* Replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

Note

`mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
    const connection = await createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


      // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
      disableEval: true,
    });


    try {
      // Sample query
      const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ results, fields });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid credentials and network access.

Note

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you must allow Cloudflare IPs to be able to access your database. You can either allow-list all IP address ranges (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255) or restrict your IP access control list to the [IP ranges used by Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/firewall-and-networking-configuration/).

Alternatively, you can connect to your databases over in your private network using [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

### Azure Portal

#### Public access networking

To connect to your Azure Database for MySQL instance using public Internet connectivity:

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the instance you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Expand **Settings** > **Networking** > ensure **Public access** is enabled > in **Firewall rules** add `0.0.0.0` as **Start IP address** and `255.255.255.255` as **End IP address**.
3. Select **Save** to persist your changes.
4. Select **Overview** from the sidebar and note down the **Server name** of your instance.

With the username, password, server name, and database name (default: `mysql`), you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

#### Private access networking

To connect to a private Azure Database for MySQL instance, refer to [Connect to a private database using Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `mysql`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command.

* Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or,
* Replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

Note

`mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
    const connection = await createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


      // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
      disableEval: true,
    });


    try {
      // Sample query
      const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ results, fields });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a Google Cloud SQL MySQL database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

Note

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you must allow Cloudflare IPs to be able to access your database. You can either allow-list all IP address ranges (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255) or restrict your IP access control list to the [IP ranges used by Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/firewall-and-networking-configuration/).

Alternatively, you can connect to your databases over in your private network using [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

### Cloud Console

When creating the instance or when editing an existing instance in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances):

To allow Hyperdrive to reach your instance:

1. In the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances), select the instance you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Expand **Connections** > **Networking** > ensure **Public IP** is enabled > **Add a Network** and input `0.0.0.0/0`.
3. Select **Done** > **Save** to persist your changes.
4. Select **Overview** from the sidebar and note down the **Public IP address** of your instance.

To create a user for Hyperdrive to connect as:

1. Select **Users** in the sidebar.
2. Select **Add User Account** > select **Built-in authentication**.
3. Provide a name (for example, `hyperdrive-user`), then select **Generate** to generate a password.
4. Copy this password to your clipboard before selecting **Add** to create the user.

With the username, password, public IP address and (optional) database name (default: `mysql`), you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `mysql`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command.

* Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or,
* Replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

Note

`mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
    const connection = await createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


      // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
      disableEval: true,
    });


    try {
      // Sample query
      const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ results, fields });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) MySQL database.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing PlanetScale database by creating a new user and fetching your database connection string.

### Planetscale Dashboard

1. Go to the [**PlanetScale dashboard**](https://app.planetscale.com/) and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. Click **Connect**. Enter `hyperdrive-user` as the password name (or your preferred name) and configure the permissions as desired. Select **Create password**. Note the username and password as they will not be displayed again.
3. Select **Other** as your language or framework. Note down the database host, database name, database username, and password. You will need these to create a database configuration in Hyperdrive.

With the host, database name, username and password, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `mysql`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command.

* Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or,
* Replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc

    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

Note

`mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
    const connection = await createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


      // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
      disableEval: true,
    });


    try {
      // Sample query
      const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ results, fields });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

Note

When connecting to a Planetscale database with Hyperdrive, you should use a driver like [node-postgres (pg)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/node-postgres/) or [Postgres.js](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/postgres-js/) to connect directly to the underlying database instead of the [Planetscale serverless driver](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver). Hyperdrive is optimized for database access for Workers and will perform global connection pooling and fast query routing by connecting directly to your database.

## Next steps

---

[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is a lightweight TypeScript ORM with a focus on type safety. This example demonstrates how to use Drizzle ORM with MySQL via Cloudflare Hyperdrive in a Workers application.

## Prerequisites

* A Cloudflare account with Workers access
* A MySQL database
* A [Hyperdrive configuration to your MySQL database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/get-started/#3-connect-hyperdrive-to-a-database)

## 1. Install Drizzle

Install the Drizzle ORM and its dependencies such as the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

```sh
# mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
npm i drizzle-orm mysql2 dotenv
npm i -D drizzle-kit tsx @types/node
```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

## 2. Configure Drizzle

### 2.1. Define a schema

With Drizzle ORM, we define the schema in TypeScript rather than writing raw SQL.

1. Create a folder `/db/` in `/src/`.

2. Create a `schema.ts` file.

3. In `schema.ts`, define a `users` table as shown below.

   ```ts
   // src/schema.ts
   import { mysqlTable, int, varchar, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/mysql-core";


   export const users = mysqlTable("users", {
     id: int("id").primaryKey().autoincrement(),
     name: varchar("name", { length: 255 }).notNull(),
     email: varchar("email", { length: 255 }).notNull().unique(),
     createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
   });
   ```

### 2.2. Connect Drizzle ORM to the database with Hyperdrive

Use your the credentials of your Hyperdrive configuration for your database when using the Drizzle ORM.

Populate your `index.ts` file as shown below.

```ts
// src/index.ts


import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/mysql2";
import { createConnection } from "mysql2";
import { users } from "./db/schema";


export interface Env {
  HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
  }


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
    const connection = await createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


      // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
      disableEval: true,
    });


    // Create the Drizzle client with the mysql2 driver connection
    const db = drizzle(connection);


    // Sample query to get all users
    const allUsers = await db.select().from(users);


    return Response.json(allUsers);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

### 2.3. Configure Drizzle-Kit for migrations (optional)

Note

You need to set up the tables in your database so that Drizzle ORM can make queries that work.

If you have already set it up (for example, if another user has applied the schema to your database), or if you are starting to use Drizzle ORM and the schema matches what already exists in your database, then you do not need to run the migration.

You can generate and run SQL migrations on your database based on your schema using Drizzle Kit CLI. Refer to [Drizzle ORM docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/mysql-new) for additional guidance.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root folder of your project, and add your database connection string. The Drizzle Kit CLI will use this connection string to create and apply the migrations.

   ```toml
   # .env
   # Replace with your direct database connection string
   DATABASE_URL='mysql://user:password@db-host.cloud/database-name'
   ```

2. Create a `drizzle.config.ts` file in the root folder of your project to configure Drizzle Kit and add the following content:

   ```ts
   import 'dotenv/config';
   import { defineConfig } from 'drizzle-kit';
   export default defineConfig({
   out: './drizzle',
   schema: './src/db/schema.ts',
   dialect: 'mysql',
   dbCredentials: {
   url: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
     },
   });
   ```

3. Generate the migration file for your database according to your schema files and apply the migrations to your database.

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit generate
   ```

   ```bash
   No config path provided, using default 'drizzle.config.ts'
   Reading config file 'drizzle.config.ts'
   Reading schema files:
   /src/db/schema.ts


   1 tables
   users 4 columns 0 indexes 0 fks


   [✓] Your SQL migration file ➜ drizzle/0000_daffy_rhodey.sql 🚀
   ```

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit migrate
   ```

   ```bash
   No config path provided, using default 'drizzle.config.ts'
   Reading config file 'drizzle.config.ts'
   ```

## 3. Deploy your Worker

Deploy your Worker.

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
    const connection = await createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


      // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
      disableEval: true,
    });


    try {
      // Sample query
      const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ results, fields });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Postgres or Amazon Aurora database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

Note

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you must allow Cloudflare IPs to be able to access your database. You can either allow-list all IP address ranges (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255) or restrict your IP access control list to the [IP ranges used by Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/firewall-and-networking-configuration/).

Alternatively, you can connect to your databases over in your private network using [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

### AWS Console

When creating or modifying an instance in the AWS console:

1. Configure a **DB cluster identifier** and other settings you wish to customize.
2. Under **Settings** > **Credential settings**, note down the **Master username** and **Master password** (Aurora only).
3. Under the **Connectivity** header, ensure **Public access** is set to **Yes**.
4. Select an **Existing VPC security group** that allows public Internet access from `0.0.0.0/0` to the port your database instance is configured to listen on (default: `5432` for PostgreSQL instances).
5. Select **Create database**.

Warning

You must ensure that the [VPC security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html) associated with your database allows public IPv4 access to your database port.

Refer to AWS' [database server rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules-reference.html#sg-rules-db-server) for details on how to configure rules specific to your RDS or Aurora database.

### Retrieve the database endpoint (Aurora)

To retrieve the database endpoint (hostname) for Hyperdrive to connect to:

1. Go to **Databases** view under **RDS** in the AWS console.
2. Select the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
3. Under the **Endpoints** header, note down the **Endpoint name** with the type `Writer` and the **Port**.

### Retrieve the database endpoint (RDS PostgreSQL)

For regular RDS instances (non-Aurora), you will need to fetch the endpoint and port of the database:

1. Go to **Databases** view under **RDS** in the AWS console.
2. Select the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
3. Under the **Connectivity & security** header, note down the **Endpoint** and the **Port**.

The endpoint will resemble `YOUR_DATABASE_NAME.cpuo5rlli58m.AWS_REGION.rds.amazonaws.com` and the port will default to `5432`.

## 2. Create your user

Once your database is created, you will need to create a user for Hyperdrive to connect as. Although you can use the **Master username** configured during initial database creation, best practice is to create a less privileged user.

To create a new user, log in to the database and use the `CREATE ROLE` command:

```sh
# Log in to the database
psql postgresql://MASTER_USERNAME:MASTER_PASSWORD@ENDPOINT_NAME:PORT/database_name
```

Run the following SQL statements:

```sql
-- Create a role for Hyperdrive
CREATE ROLE hyperdrive;


-- Allow Hyperdrive to connect
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO hyperdrive;


-- Grant database privileges to the hyperdrive role
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE postgres to hyperdrive;


-- Create a specific user for Hyperdrive to log in as
CREATE ROLE hyperdrive_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'sufficientlyRandomPassword';


-- Grant this new user the hyperdrive role privileges
GRANT hyperdrive to hyperdrive_user;
```

Refer to AWS' [documentation on user roles in PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.Roles.html) for more details.

With a database user, password, database endpoint (hostname and port) and database name (default: `postgres`), you can now set up Hyperdrive.

## 3. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.

## Next steps

* Learn more about [How Hyperdrive Works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/how-hyperdrive-works/).
* Refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug common issues.
* Understand more about other [storage options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/storage-options/) available to Cloudflare Workers.

Alternatively, you can connect to your databases over in your private network using [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

### Azure Portal

#### Public access networking

To connect to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance using public Internet connectivity:

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the instance you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Expand **Settings** > **Networking** > ensure **Public access** is enabled > in **Firewall rules** add `0.0.0.0` as **Start IP address** and `255.255.255.255` as **End IP address**.
3. Select **Save** to persist your changes.
4. Select **Overview** from the sidebar and note down the **Server name** of your instance.

With the username, password, server name, and database name (default: `postgres`), you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

#### Private access networking

To connect to a private Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance, refer to [Connect to a private database using Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({

title: CockroachDB · Hyperdrive docs
description: Connect Hyperdrive to a CockroachDB database.
lastUpdated: 2025-05-12T14:16:48.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/cockroachdb/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/cockroachdb/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) database cluster. CockroachDB is a PostgreSQL-compatible distributed SQL database with strong consistency guarantees.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

### CockroachDB Console

The steps below assume you have an [existing CockroachDB Cloud account](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart) and database cluster created.

To create and/or fetch your database credentials:

1. Go to the [CockroachDB Cloud console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/clusters) and select the cluster you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Select **SQL Users** from the sidebar on the left, and select **Add User**.
3. Enter a username (for example, \`hyperdrive-user), and select **Generate & Save Password**.
4. Note down the username and copy the password to a temporary location.

To retrieve your database connection details:

1. Go to the [CockroachDB Cloud console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/clusters) and select the cluster you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Select **Connect** in the top right.
3. Choose the user you created, for example,`hyperdrive-user`.
4. Select the database, for example `defaultdb`.
5. Select **General connection string** as the option.
6. In the text box below, select **Copy** to copy the connection string.

By default, the CockroachDB cloud enables connections from the public Internet (`0.0.0.0/0`). If you have changed these settings on an existing cluster, you will need to allow connections from the public Internet for Hyperdrive to connect.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections.

---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a Digital Ocean database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

### DigitalOcean Dashboard

1. Go to the DigitalOcean dashboard and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. Go to the **Overview** tab.
3. Under the **Connection Details** panel, select **Public network**.
4. On the dropdown menu, select **Connection string** > **show-password**.
5. Copy the connection string.

With the connection string, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.

## Next steps

* Learn more about [How Hyperdrive Works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/how-hyperdrive-works/).
* Refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug common issues.
* Understand more about other [storage options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/storage-options/) available to Cloudflare Workers.

Note

If you see a DNS-related error, it is possible that the DNS for your vendor's database has not yet been propagated. Try waiting 10 minutes before retrying the operation. Refer to [DigitalOcean support page](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/why-does-my-domain-fail-to-resolve/) for more information.

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/fly/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a Fly Postgres database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Fly database by:

1. Allocating a public IP address to your Fly database instance
2. Configuring an external service
3. Deploying the configuration
4. Obtain the connection string, which is used to connect the database to Hyperdrive.

1) Run the following command to [allocate a public IP address](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-external/#allocate-an-ip-address).

   ```txt
   fly ips allocate-v6 --app <pg-app-name>
   ```

   Note

   Cloudflare recommends using IPv6, but some Internet service providers may not support IPv6. In this case, [you can allocate an IPv4 address](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-with-flyctl/).

2) [Configure an external service](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-external/#configure-an-external-service) by modifying the contents of your `fly.toml` file. Run the following command to download the `fly.toml` file.

   ```txt
   fly config save --app <pg-app-name>
   ```

   Then, replace the `services` and `services.ports` section of the file with the following `toml` snippet:

   ```toml
   [[services]]
     internal_port = 5432 # Postgres instance
     protocol = "tcp"


   [[services.ports]]
     handlers = ["pg_tls"]
     port = 5432
   ```

3) [Deploy the new configuration](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-external/#deploy-with-the-new-configuration).

4) [Obtain the connection string](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-external/#adapting-the-connection-string), which is in the form of:

   ```txt
   postgres://{username}:{password}@{public-hostname}:{port}/{database}?options
   ```

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

title: Google Cloud SQL · Hyperdrive docs
description: Connect Hyperdrive to a Google Cloud SQL for Postgres database instance.
lastUpdated: 2025-05-12T14:16:48.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/google-cloud-sql/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/google-cloud-sql/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a Google Cloud SQL Postgres database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

Note

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you must allow Cloudflare IPs to be able to access your database. You can either allow-list all IP address ranges (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255) or restrict your IP access control list to the [IP ranges used by Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/firewall-and-networking-configuration/).

Alternatively, you can connect to your databases over in your private network using [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).

### Cloud Console

When creating the instance or when editing an existing instance in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances):

To allow Hyperdrive to reach your instance:

1. In the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances), select the instance you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Expand **Connections** > **Networking** > ensure **Public IP** is enabled > **Add a Network** and input `0.0.0.0/0`.
3. Select **Done** > **Save** to persist your changes.
4. Select **Overview** from the sidebar and note down the **Public IP address** of your instance.

To create a user for Hyperdrive to connect as:

1. Select **Users** in the sidebar.
2. Select **Add User Account** > select **Built-in authentication**.
3. Provide a name (for example, `hyperdrive-user`) > select **Generate** to generate a password.
4. Copy this password to your clipboard before selecting **Add** to create the user.

With the username, password, public IP address and (optional) database name (default: `postgres`), you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

### gcloud CLI

The [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) allows you to create a new user and enable Hyperdrive to connect to your database.

Use `gcloud sql` to create a new user (for example, `hyperdrive-user`) with a strong password:

```sh
gcloud sql users create hyperdrive-user --instance=YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME --password=SUFFICIENTLY_LONG_PASSWORD
```

Run the following command to enable [Internet access](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/configure-ip) to your database instance:

```sh
# If you have any existing authorized networks, ensure you provide those as a comma separated list.
# The gcloud CLI will replace any existing authorized networks with the list you provide here.
gcloud sql instances patch YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME --authorized-networks="0.0.0.0/0"
```

Refer to [Google Cloud's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-manage-users) for additional configuration options.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",

      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

title: Materialize · Hyperdrive docs
description: Connect Hyperdrive to a Materialize streaming database.
lastUpdated: 2025-05-12T14:16:48.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/materialize/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/materialize/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [Materialize](https://materialize.com/) database. Materialize is a Postgres-compatible streaming database that can automatically compute real-time results against your streaming data sources.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access to your database.

### Materialize Console

Note

Read the Materialize [Quickstart guide](https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/quickstart/) to set up your first database. The steps below assume you have an existing Materialize database ready to go.

You will need to create a new application user and password for Hyperdrive to connect with:

1. Log in to the [Materialize Console](https://console.materialize.com/).
2. Under the **App Passwords** section, select **Manage app passwords**.
3. Select **New app password** and enter a name, for example, `hyperdrive-user`.
4. Select **Create Password**.
5. Copy the provided password: it will only be shown once.

To retrieve the hostname and database name of your Materialize configuration:

1. Select **Connect** in the sidebar of the Materialize Console.
2. Select **External tools**.
3. Copy the **Host**, **Port** and **Database** settings.

With the username, app password, hostname, port and database name, you can now connect Hyperdrive to your Materialize database.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.

## Next steps

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/neon/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [Neon](https://neon.tech/) Postgres database.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Neon database by creating a new user and fetching your database connection string.

### Neon Dashboard

1. Go to the [**Neon dashboard**](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) and select the project (database) you wish to connect to.
2. Select **Roles** from the sidebar and select **New Role**. Enter `hyperdrive-user` as the name (or your preferred name) and **copy the password**. Note that the password will not be displayed again: you will have to reset it if you do not save it somewhere.
3. Select **Dashboard** from the sidebar > go to the **Connection Details** pane > ensure you have selected the **branch**, **database** and **role** (for example,`hyperdrive-user`) that Hyperdrive will connect through.
4. Select the `psql` and **uncheck the connection pooling** checkbox. Note down the connection string (starting with `postgres://hyperdrive-user@...`) from the text box.

With both the connection string and the password, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.

Note

When connecting to a Neon database with Hyperdrive, you should use a driver like [node-postgres (pg)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/node-postgres/) or [Postgres.js](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/postgres-js/) to connect directly to the underlying database instead of the [Neon serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver). Hyperdrive is optimized for database access for Workers and will perform global connection pooling and fast query routing by connecting directly to your database.

title: Nile · Hyperdrive docs
description: Connect Hyperdrive to a Nile Postgres database instance.
lastUpdated: 2025-05-12T14:16:48.000Z

source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/nile/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/nile/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [Nile](https://thenile.dev) PostgreSQL database instance.

Nile is PostgreSQL re-engineered for multi-tenant applications. Nile's virtual tenant databases provide you with isolation, placement, insight, and other features for your tenant's data and embedding. Refer to [Nile documentation](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/getting-started/whatisnile) to learn more.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Cloudflare Hyperdrive to any Nile database in your workspace using its connection string - either with a new set of credentials, or using an existing set.

### Nile console

To get a connection string from Nile console:

1. Log in to [Nile console](https://console.thenile.dev), then select a database.
2. On the left hand menu, click **Settings** (the bottom-most icon) and then select **Connection**.
3. Select the PostgreSQL logo to show the connection string.
4. Select "Generate credentials" to generate new credentials.
5. Copy the connection string (without the "psql" part).

You will have obtained a connection string similar to the following:

```txt
    postgres://0191c898-...:4d7d8b45-...@eu-central-1.db.thenile.dev:5432/my_database
```

With the connection string, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

title: pgEdge Cloud · Hyperdrive docs
description: Connect Hyperdrive to a pgEdge Postgres database.
lastUpdated: 2025-05-12T14:16:48.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/pgedge/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/pgedge/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [pgEdge](https://pgedge.com/) Postgres database. pgEdge Cloud provides easy deployment of fully-managed, fully-distributed, and secure Postgres.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing pgEdge database with the default user and password provided by pgEdge.

### pgEdge dashboard

To retrieve your connection string from the pgEdge dashboard:

1. Go to the [**pgEdge dashboard**](https://app.pgedge.com) and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. From the **Connect to your database** section, note down the connection string (starting with `postgres://app@...`) from the **Connection String** text box.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/supabase/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) Postgres database.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Supabase database as the Postgres user which is set up during project creation. Alternatively, to create a new user for Hyperdrive, run these commands in the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new).

```sql
CREATE ROLE hyperdrive_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'sufficientlyRandomPassword';


-- Here, you are granting it the postgres role. In practice, you want to create a role with lesser privileges.
GRANT postgres to hyperdrive_user;
```

The database endpoint can be found in the [database settings page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database).

With a database user, password, database endpoint (hostname and port) and database name (default: postgres), you can now set up Hyperdrive.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.

Note

When connecting to a Supabase database with Hyperdrive, you should use a driver like [node-postgres (pg)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/node-postgres/) or [Postgres.js](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/postgres-js/) to connect directly to the underlying database instead of the [Supabase JavaScript client](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js). Hyperdrive is optimized for database access for Workers and will perform global connection pooling and fast query routing by connecting directly to your database.

title: Timescale · Hyperdrive docs
description: Connect Hyperdrive to a Timescale time-series database.
lastUpdated: 2025-05-12T14:16:48.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/timescale/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/timescale/index.md
---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/) time-series database. Timescale is built on PostgreSQL, and includes powerful time-series, event and analytics features.

You can learn more about Timescale by referring to their [Timescale services documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/latest/services/).

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Timescale database by creating a new user and fetching your database connection string.

### Timescale Dashboard

Note

Similar to most services, Timescale requires you to reset the password associated with your database user if you do not have it stored securely. You should ensure that you do not break any existing clients if when you reset the password.

To retrieve your credentials and database endpoint in the [Timescale Console](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/):

1. Select the service (database) you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Expand **Connection info**.
3. Copy the **Service URL**. The Service URL is the connection string that Hyperdrive will use to connect. This string includes the database hostname, port number and database name.

If you do not have your password stored, you will need to select **Forgot your password?** and set a new **SCRAM** password. Save this password, as Timescale will only display it once.

You will end up with a connection string resembling the below:

```txt
postgres://tsdbadmin:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@pn79dztyy0.xzhhbfensb.tsdb.cloud.timescale.com:31358/tsdb
```

With the connection string, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command. Replace \<NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",

    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

---

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a Xata PostgreSQL database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Xata database with the default user and password provided by Xata.

### Xata dashboard

To retrieve your connection string from the Xata dashboard:

1. Go to the [**Xata dashboard**](https://app.xata.io/).
2. Select the database you want to connect to.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Copy the connection string from the `PostgreSQL endpoint` section and add your API key.

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.

title: Drizzle ORM · Hyperdrive docs
description: Drizzle ORM is a lightweight TypeScript ORM with a focus on type
  safety. This example demonstrates how to use Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL via
  Cloudflare Hyperdrive in a Workers application.

---

[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is a lightweight TypeScript ORM with a focus on type safety. This example demonstrates how to use Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL via Cloudflare Hyperdrive in a Workers application.

## Prerequisites

* A Cloudflare account with Workers access
* A PostgreSQL database
* A [Hyperdrive configuration to your PostgreSQL database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/get-started/#3-connect-hyperdrive-to-a-database)

## 1. Install Drizzle

Install the Drizzle ORM and its dependencies such as the [postgres](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) driver:

```sh
# postgres 3.4.5 or later is recommended
npm i drizzle-orm postgres dotenv
npm i -D drizzle-kit tsx @types/node
```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

## 2. Configure Drizzle

### 2.1. Define a schema

With Drizzle ORM, we define the schema in TypeScript rather than writing raw SQL.

1. Create a folder `/db/` in `/src/`.

2. Create a `schema.ts` file.

3. In `schema.ts`, define a `users` table as shown below.

   ```ts
   // src/db/schema.ts
   import { pgTable, serial, varchar, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";


   export const users = pgTable("users", {
     id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
     name: varchar("name", { length: 255 }).notNull(),
     email: varchar("email", { length: 255 }).notNull().unique(),
     createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
   });
   ```

### 2.2. Connect Drizzle ORM to the database with Hyperdrive

Use your Hyperdrive configuration for your database when using the Drizzle ORM.

Populate your `index.ts` file as shown below.

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import postgres from "postgres";
import { users } from "./db/schema";


export interface Env {
  HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
}

Note

You may use [node-postgres](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#node-postgres) or [Postgres.js](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#postgresjs) when using Drizzle ORM. Both are supported and compatible.

### 2.3. Configure Drizzle-Kit for migrations (optional)

Note

You need to set up the tables in your database so that Drizzle ORM can make queries that work.

If you have already set it up (for example, if another user has applied the schema to your database), or if you are starting to use Drizzle ORM and the schema matches what already exists in your database, then you do not need to run the migration.

You can generate and run SQL migrations on your database based on your schema using Drizzle Kit CLI. Refer to [Drizzle ORM docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/postgresql-new) for additional guidance.

1. Create a `.env` file the root folder of your project, and add your database connection string. The Drizzle Kit CLI will use this connection string to create and apply the migrations.

   ```toml
   # .env
   # Replace with your direct database connection string
   DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:password@db-host.cloud/database-name'
   ```

2. Create a `drizzle.config.ts` file in the root folder of your project to configure Drizzle Kit and add the following content:

   ```ts
   // drizzle.config.ts
   import "dotenv/config";
   import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";
   export default defineConfig({
     out: "./drizzle",
     schema: "./src/db/schema.ts",
     dialect: "postgresql",
     dbCredentials: {
       url: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
     },
   });
   ```

3. Generate the migration file for your database according to your schema files and apply the migrations to your database.

   Run the following two commands:

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit generate
   ```

   ```bash
   No config path provided, using default 'drizzle.config.ts'
   Reading config file 'drizzle.config.ts'
   1 tables
   users 4 columns 0 indexes 0 fks


   [✓] Your SQL migration file ➜ drizzle/0000_mysterious_queen_noir.sql 🚀
   ```

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit migrate
   ```

   ```bash
   No config path provided, using default 'drizzle.config.ts'
   Reading config file 'drizzle.config.ts'
   Using 'postgres' driver for database querying
   ```

## 3. Deploy your Worker

Deploy your Worker.

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

[node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) (pg) is a widely-used PostgreSQL driver for Node.js applications. This example demonstrates how to use node-postgres with Cloudflare Hyperdrive in a Workers application.

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response('Internal error occurred', { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.

[Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) is a modern, fully-featured PostgreSQL driver for Node.js. This example demonstrates how to use Postgres.js with Cloudflare Hyperdrive in a Workers application.

Install [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres):

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i postgres@>3.4.5
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add postgres@>3.4.5
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add postgres@>3.4.5
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `postgres-js` required for Hyperdrive is `3.4.5`.

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a Worker that connects to your PostgreSQL database via Hyperdrive:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import postgres from "postgres";


export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext,
  ): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a database client that connects to your database via Hyperdrive
    // using the Hyperdrive credentials
    const sql = postgres(env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString, {
      // Limit the connections for the Worker request to 5 due to Workers' limits on concurrent external connections
      max: 5,
      // If you are not using array types in your Postgres schema, disable `fetch_types` to avoid an additional round-trip (unnecessary latency)
      fetch_types: false,
    });


    try {
      // A very simple test query
      const result = await sql`select * from pg_tables`;


      // Clean up the client, ensuring we don't kill the worker before that is
      // completed.
      ctx.waitUntil(sql.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ success: true, result: result });
    } catch (e: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", e.message);


      return Response.error();
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```
