This guide instructs you on how to:

* View AI crawlers that are interacting with pages in your domain (a [Cloudflare zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones)).
* Use AI Audit to block individual crawlers from accessing your content.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/).
2. [Connect your domain to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).
3. Make sure your domain is [proxying traffic through Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#cloudflare-as-a-reverse-proxy).

## 1. Block specific AI crawlers

* All plans

  To only block specific AI crawlers:

  1. Go to **AI Audit**.
  2. From the **AI Crawlers** tab, go to the list of AI crawlers.
  3. Review the AI crawlers that are accessing your domain.
  4. From the **Block** column, select the option **Block**.

  Quality of AI crawler detection

  On the free plan, AI Audit identifies AI crawlers based on their [user agent strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent). This enables AI Audit to detect easy-to-detect (well-known) AI crawlers.

  Upgrade your plan to enable a more thorough detection using Cloudflare's [Bot Management detection ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-management-variables/#ruleset-engine-fields) field.

* Paid plans

  To only block specific AI crawlers:

  1. Go to **AI Audit**.

  2. From the **AI Crawlers** tab, go to the list of AI crawlers.

  3. Review key information such as:

     * Bot operator
     * Number of requests sent by the AI crawler
     * Whether the AI crawler is allowed according to your `robots.txt`, or the number of times the AI crawler has violated your `robots.txt`.

  4. From the **Block** column, toggle the switch for AI crawlers you wish to block.

For more information, refer to [Manage AI crawlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/manage-ai-crawlers/).

You can also create more complex rules when taking action on AI crawlers, using [Cloudflare WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/). For more information on creating more specific rules, refer to [Create a custom rule in the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/).

## 2. Review detected AI crawlers

* All plans

  Review the AI crawlers detected on your site.

  1. Go to **AI Audit**.
  2. From the **Metrics** tab, view key metrics on AI crawlers.

Note that on free plans, the **Metrics** tab only displays metrics for the past 24 hours.

## Plan comparison

| All plans | Enterprise plans with Bot Management |
| - | - |
| AI crawler detection via [user agent strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent) | Advanced AI crawler detection via [Bot Management detection ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-management-variables/#ruleset-engine-fields) |
| Maximum 24-hour analytics window | Configurable analytics timeframes |
| Allow/block controls | Allow/block controls, and the ability to charge AI crawlers using [pay per crawl](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/) |

## Next steps

* [Manage AI crawlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/manage-ai-crawlers/) with granular allow/block controls.
* [Analyze AI traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/analyze-ai-traffic/) to understand crawler patterns and content popularity.
* [Explore pay per crawl](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/) to test content monetization options (private beta).

AI Audit works alongside other Cloudflare products, such as Cloudflare [bot solutions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/). Bot solutions identifies traffic matching patterns of known bots, and can challenge or block the bots as you wish.

## Order of precedence

* AI Audit's AI crawler blocking uses [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/), which take place before Cloudflare bot solutions.
* AI Audit's pay per crawl takes place after Cloudflare bot solutions.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Traffic] --> B[WAF custom rules<br>AI Audit: Crawler blocks]
B --> C[Cloudflare<br>Bot Solutions]
C --> D[AI Audit:<br>Pay Per Crawl]
classDef highlight fill:#F6821F,color:white
```

For more information on how Cloudflare bot solutions works with WAF custom rules, refer to [How it works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#how-it-works).

## Examples

Consider the following examples.

### Bot rule which blocks all AI bots vs pay per crawl

You may have both of the following enabled:

* A selection of AI crawlers to be charged through AI Audit's pay per crawl
* Bot configuration option to [Block AI Bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-fight-mode/#block-ai-bots).

Since pay per crawl happens after bot solutions, you need to first turn off **Block AI Bots** to ensure pay per crawl works as intended.

AI Audit works alongside other Cloudflare products, such as Cloudflare [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/). WAF checks incoming web and API requests, and filters undesired traffic based on rules. [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) allow you to perform certain actions such as enforcing `robots.txt`.

## Order of precedence

* AI Audit uses WAF custom rules to block the selection of AI crawlers the site owner has decided to block.
* AI Audit's pay per crawl feature takes place after WAF.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Traffic] --> B[WAF custom rules<br>AI Audit: Crawler blocks]
B --> C[Cloudflare<br>Bot Solutions]
C --> D[AI Audit:<br>Pay Per Crawl]
classDef highlight fill:#F6821F,color:white
```

For this reason, if you plan on using AI Audit to manage AI crawlers, you may wish to modify your existing WAF custom rules such that it does not affect AI crawlers. This will allow you to manage AI crawlers only from AI Audit, thereby streamlining your workflow.

How AI Audit uses WAF custom rules

When you block AI crawlers via AI Audit (either all or some), you are using **one** WAF custom rule to block those AI crawlers.

If you choose to allow all AI crawlers, AI Audit does not utilize any WAF custom rules.

Depending on the type of account you have, you may have a limited number of WAF custom rules.

## Examples of using WAF vs AI Audit

Consider the following examples.

### Traffic from a restricted country vs pay per crawl

You may have both of the following features enabled:

* [WAF custom rule to block traffic from specific countries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/block-traffic-from-specific-countries/)
* AI Audit's [pay per crawl](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/) to charge AI crawlers when they request access to your content

Since WAF custom rules are enforced before pay per crawl, traffic (including AI crawlers) from your blocked countries will continue to be blocked, even if they provide the [required headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/use-pay-per-crawl-as-ai-owner/crawl-pages/#1-include-required-headers) for pay per crawl.

### Allowed search engine bots via WAF custom rule vs pay per crawl

You may have both of the following features enabled:

* [WAF custom rule to allow search engine bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/allow-traffic-from-verified-bots/)
* AI Audit's [pay per crawl](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/) to charge all AI crawlers when they request access to your content (including search engine bots).

Since custom rules are enforced before pay per crawl:

* Only search engine bots will be able to access your site (enforced by custom rule).
* The search engine bots will then be charged for access to your content (enforced by AI Audit's pay per crawl).

Note

This example only serves to highlight the order of precedence between WAF and AI Audit.

Practically, it may be beneficial to allow well-behaved search engine bots to access your content to ensure your content is indexed.

### Conflict in AI crawler blocking logic

You may have both of the following features enabled:

* A WAF custom rule which blocks all bots.
* AI Audit selection which allows certain AI crawlers.

In this scenario, you have two custom rules, each directing a different logic for handling AI crawlers. To resolve this issue:

* Old dashboard

  1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
  2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Custom rules** tab.
  3. Identify your WAF custom rule and the AI Audit rule.
  4. Drag the rule you wish to prioritize to the top, or modify your WAF custom rule to ensure it does not conflict with your AI Audit configurations.

* New dashboard

  1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
  2. Go to **Security** > **Security rules** and filter by **Custom rules**.
  3. Identify your custom rule and the AI Audit rule.
  4. Drag the rule you wish to prioritize to the top, or modify your custom rule to ensure it does not conflict with your AI Audit configurations.

## Take action for each AI crawler

* With pay per crawl

  Pay per crawl closed beta

  Pay per crawl is currently in closed beta.

  To find out how to join the beta program, reach out to us at [Pay per crawl signup](http://www.cloudflare.com/paypercrawl-signup/), or contact your account executive if you are an existing Enterprise customer.

  To learn more about pay per crawl, refer to Cloudflare blog: [Introducing pay per crawl: enabling content owners to charge AI crawlers for access](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/).

  For each AI crawler, you can take one of three actions: allow, charge, or block.

  Allow access

  * **Summary:** You can allow an AI crawler to scrape your content.
  * **When to use:** Allow AI crawlers that offer services which provide value through citations, referrals, or existing agreements.
  * **Implementation:** From the **Actions** column, select **Allow**. Note that you can still choose to [Enforce `robots.txt`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/manage-ai-crawlers/#take-action-for-each-ai-crawler).

  For more details on how this rule interacts with other Cloudflare settings, refer to [How it works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#how-it-works).

  Block access

  * **Summary:** You can block an AI crawler to completely stop the AI crawler from scraping your webpage.
  * **When to use:** Block AI crawlers when their behavior do not align with your content strategy, or violate your policies.
  * **Implementation:** From the **Actions** column, select **Block**.

  Charge for crawl (private beta)

  * **Summary:** You can charge the owner of the AI crawler for each crawl request.
  * **When to use:** Charge AI crawlers when your content has training value, and you want to explore monetization options
  * **Implementation:** From the **Actions** column, select **Charge**.

  For more information, refer to [What is Pay Per Crawl?](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/).

## Frequently asked questions - site owners

### Can I charge a different price for each AI crawlers?

No. Pay per crawl allows setting different configurations (Block, Charge, or Allow) for each crawler, but it only supports setting a single price for all crawlers set to "Charge".

## Frequently asked questions - bot owners

### Will I be charged multiple times if re-crawling the same page?

Every time your AI crawler accesses content in a website protected with pay per crawl, it will incur a cost, as set by the site owner. You must implement mechanisms within your crawler to track its expenditure and to enforce any desired spending limits you wish to set.

### Will I be billed for error HTTP status codes?

No. Charging events are only issued on successful HTTP response codes. Errors are not billed, even if you have sent the `crawler-exact-price` header or the `crawler-max-price` header.

### Do I need to use a specific user agent?

You should use the normal user agents associated with your AI crawler that you have onboarded to Cloudflare and identified using Web Bot Auth.

Pay per crawl closed beta

Pay per crawl is currently in closed beta.

To find out how to join the beta program, reach out to us at [Pay per crawl signup](http://www.cloudflare.com/paypercrawl-signup/), or contact your account executive if you are an existing Enterprise customer.

To learn more about pay per crawl, refer to Cloudflare blog: [Introducing pay per crawl: enabling content owners to charge AI crawlers for access](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/).

AI crawlers often consume vast amounts of web content. Some provide mutual benefit to content owners by indexing content for search engines, but others engage in activities such as content scraping without permission.

The resulting landscape leaves content owners with limited options for managing AI crawlers or receiving compensation for automated access to their intellectual property.

## What is Pay Per Crawl?

Pay per crawl is a feature of AI Audit that enables site owners to control and monetize AI crawler access to content by setting a price per zone.

Each time an AI crawler requests content, they either present payment intent via request headers for successful `HTTP 200` access, or receive an `HTTP 402 Payment Required` response with pricing. Cloudflare acts as the Merchant of Record for pay per crawl and also provides the underlying technical infrastructure.

Note

If you block an AI crawler from a zone via either of Cloudflare's [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/) or [Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-management/) products, those products' rulesets will override pay per crawl's "charge" feature, and the blocked crawler will not have access to the zone.

Ultimately, pay per crawl enables:

* Site owners to take control of their content, and charge a fee every time an AI crawler accesses a page in their [Cloudflare zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones). For more details, refer to [use pay per crawl as a site owner](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/use-pay-per-crawl-as-site-owner/).
* AI crawler owners to pay to access content on sites protected by pay per crawl. For more details, refer to [use pay per crawl as an AI owner](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/use-pay-per-crawl-as-ai-owner/).

```

Connect your Cloudflare account to Stripe to process payments. Pay per crawl uses Stripe to process payments between AI crawler owners and site owners.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account.

2. Go to **Manage Account** > **Configurations**.

3. Go to the **Pay Per Crawl** tab.

4. From **Connect to Stripe**, select **Connect**.

5. Select **Continue to Stripe**.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect your Cloudflare account to a Stripe account.

   Use a non-personal email address

   Cloudflare recommends using a dedicated email to manage your pay per crawl account (for example, `aicrawler@company.com`).

When you successfully connect Stripe to your account, you will see a green tick ✅ next to **Stripe connection**.

Spending limits

Cloudflare is not responsible for configuring spending limits. Ensure you have configured a maximum spending limit on your AI crawler.

## Billing

Charges are recorded upon successful delivery of content that is requested with valid [crawler price headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/use-pay-per-crawl-as-ai-owner/crawl-pages/#22-include-payment-headers).

Invoices are created and managed via Stripe. Crawlers are responsible for setting and enforcing their own spending limits.

Once your AI crawler complies with Web Bot Auth, you can begin to crawl webpages. For more information on how pay per crawl works, refer to [What is Pay Per Crawl?](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/)

## 1. Identify payment requirements

When an AI crawler makes a request to a page protected by pay per crawl, the server will respond with `HTTP/2 402 Payment Required`. This response will also include the `crawler-price` header which specifies the cost to access the content. For example, a response may look like the following:

```txt
HTTP/2 200
date: Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:42:38 GMT
crawler-charged: USD 0.01
```

To access this content, the AI crawler must provide headers for paid access.

## 2. Access paid content

### 2.1. Include WBA headers

Include Web Bot Auth headers by following the steps [Sign your requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/#4-after-verification-sign-your-requests)

### 2.2. Include payment headers

Your AI crawler can specify the price it is willing to pay by providing one of two headers:

* `crawler-exact-price`: This is the exact price the AI crawler is configured to pay for access. This value should exactly match the price set in the response header `crawler-price`. Include this header in your second request if your AI crawler first received a HTTP status code 402, and you wish to access the content by paying the `crawler-price`.
* `crawler-max-price`: This is the maximum price the AI crawler is configured to pay for access on any content. Use this option if you wish to access any pay per crawl content with a crawl price equal or lower than the maximum price. If a page's `crawler-price` is higher than your `crawler-max-price`, your AI crawler will receive a HTTP 402 response.

Note

Note that if a content owner has explicitly blocked your AI crawler (instead of charging your crawler), you cannot access their content, even if you provide `crawler-exact-price` or `crawler-max-price` headers.

### 2.3. Review response headers

When you specify a header to indicate payment, you may receive one of two responses:

#### Successful HTTP/2 200 response

The value of the `crawler-charged` header indicates the exact amount that will be billed to your Cloudflare account for the request.

```txt
HTTP/2 200
date: Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:42:38 GMT
crawler-charged: USD 0.01
```

#### Unsuccessful HTTP/2 402 response

If the request is unsuccessful due to an incorrect price header, you will receive a response with the `crawler-price` header. Your request header values must be adjusted to match the `crawler-price`.

```txt
HTTP/2 402
date: Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:42:38 GMT
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
crawler-price: USD 0.01
```

## 3. Track your spending

When you successfully access pay per crawl content (response with HTTP status code 200), the response will include `crawler-charged`. For example:

```plaintext
crawler-charged: USD 0.01
```

Cloudflare strongly recommends tracking and saving these values to keep an accurate record of the bill your AI crawler has accrued.

```

Once you have connected your Stripe account, set up your AI crawler as a [verified bot](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#verified-bots).

## Content access restriction

When an AI crawler tries to access content protected by pay per crawl, it receives a HTTP status code 402. This indicates payment is required. The HTTP header of the response includes the cost of the content.

For example, the response header may look like below:

```plaintext
HTTP/2 402
date: Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:42:38 GMT
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
crawler-price: USD 0.01
server: cloudflare
```

To access this content, you must verify your AI crawler.

## 1. Follow Web Bot Auth protocol

Ensure your AI crawler identifies itself with the required headers for Web Bot Auth.

Follow the steps found in [Web Both Auth](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/).

## 2. Follow verified bot policy

Ensure your AI crawler follows Cloudflare's [verified bots policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/policy/).

## 3. Submit verification request

Submit a form to add your AI crawler to Cloudflare's list of verified bots.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account.
2. Go to **Manage Account** > **Configurations**.
3. Go to the **Verified Bots** tab.
4. Fill out the form.
5. Select **Submit**.
